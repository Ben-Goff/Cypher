ONCE AGAIN TO ZELDA THEN WEAR THE GOLD HAT IF THAT WILL MOVE HER IF YOU CAN BOUNCE HIGH BOUNCE FOR HER TOO TILL SHE CRY LOVER GOLDHATTED HIGHBOUNCING LOVER I MUST HAVE YOU THOMAS PARKE DINVILLIERS I IN MY YOUNGER AND MORE VULNERABLE YEARS MY FATHER GAVE ME SOME ADVICE THAT IVE BEEN TURNING OVER IN MY MIND EVER SINCE WHENEVER YOU FEEL LIKE CRITICIZING ANYONE HE TOLD ME JUST REMEMBER THAT ALL THE PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD HAVENT HAD THE ADVANTAGES THAT YOUVE HAD HE DIDNT SAY ANY MORE BUT WEVE ALWAYS BEEN UNUSUALLY COMMUNICATIVE IN A RESERVED WAY AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT HE MEANT A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN THAT IN CONSEQUENCE IM INCLINED TO RESERVE ALL JUDGEMENTS A HABIT THAT HAS OPENED UP MANY CURIOUS NATURES TO ME AND ALSO MADE ME THE VICTIM OF NOT A FEW VETERAN BORES THE ABNORMAL MIND IS QUICK TO DETECT AND ATTACH ITSELF TO THIS QUALITY WHEN IT APPEARS IN A NORMAL PERSON AND SO IT CAME ABOUT THAT IN COLLEGE I WAS UNJUSTLY ACCUSED OF BEING A POLITICIAN BECAUSE I WAS PRIVY TO THE SECRET GRIEFS OF WILD UNKNOWN MEN MOST OF THE CONFIDENCES WERE UNSOUGHT FREQUENTLY I HAVE FEIGNED SLEEP PREOCCUPATION OR A HOSTILE LEVITY WHEN I REALIZED BY SOME UNMISTAKABLE SIGN THAT AN INTIMATE REVELATION WAS QUIVERING ON THE HORIZON FOR THE INTIMATE REVELATIONS OF YOUNG MEN OR AT LEAST THE TERMS IN WHICH THEY EXPRESS THEM ARE USUALLY PLAGIARISTIC AND MARRED BY OBVIOUS SUPPRESSIONS RESERVING JUDGEMENTS IS A MATTER OF INFINITE HOPE I AM STILL A LITTLE AFRAID OF MISSING SOMETHING IF I FORGET THAT AS MY FATHER SNOBBISHLY SUGGESTED AND I SNOBBISHLY REPEAT A SENSE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL DECENCIES IS PARCELLED OUT UNEQUALLY AT BIRTH AND AFTER BOASTING THIS WAY OF MY TOLERANCE I COME TO THE ADMISSION THAT IT HAS A LIMIT CONDUCT MAY BE FOUNDED ON THE HARD ROCK OR THE WET MARSHES BUT AFTER A CERTAIN POINT I DONT CARE WHAT ITS FOUNDED ON WHEN I CAME BACK FROM THE EAST LAST AUTUMN I FELT THAT I WANTED THE WORLD TO BE IN UNIFORM AND AT A SORT OF MORAL ATTENTION FOREVER I WANTED NO MORE RIOTOUS EXCURSIONS WITH PRIVILEGED GLIMPSES INTO THE HUMAN HEART ONLY GATSBY THE MAN WHO GIVES HIS NAME TO THIS BOOK WAS EXEMPT FROM MY REACTION GATSBY WHO REPRESENTED EVERYTHING FOR WHICH I HAVE AN UNAFFECTED SCORN IF PERSONALITY IS AN UNBROKEN SERIES OF SUCCESSFUL GESTURES THEN THERE WAS SOMETHING GORGEOUS ABOUT HIM SOME HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITY TO THE PROMISES OF LIFE AS IF HE WERE RELATED TO ONE OF THOSE INTRICATE MACHINES THAT REGISTER EARTHQUAKES TEN THOUSAND MILES AWAY THIS RESPONSIVENESS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT FLABBY IMPRESSIONABILITY WHICH IS DIGNIFIED UNDER THE NAME OF THE CREATIVE TEMPERAMENT IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY GIFT FOR HOPE A ROMANTIC READINESS SUCH AS I HAVE NEVER FOUND IN ANY OTHER PERSON AND WHICH IT IS NOT LIKELY I SHALL EVER FIND AGAIN NO GATSBY TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT AT THE END IT IS WHAT PREYED ON GATSBY WHAT FOUL DUST FLOATED IN THE WAKE OF HIS DREAMS THAT TEMPORARILY CLOSED OUT MY INTEREST IN THE ABORTIVE SORROWS AND SHORTWINDED ELATIONS OF MEN MY FAMILY HAVE BEEN PROMINENT WELLTODO PEOPLE IN THIS MIDDLE WESTERN CITY FOR THREE GENERATIONS THE CARRAWAYS ARE SOMETHING OF A CLAN AND WE HAVE A TRADITION THAT WERE DESCENDED FROM THE DUKES OF BUCCLEUCH BUT THE ACTUAL FOUNDER OF MY LINE WAS MY GRANDFATHERS BROTHER WHO CAME HERE IN FIFTYONE SENT A SUBSTITUTE TO THE CIVIL WAR AND STARTED THE WHOLESALE HARDWARE BUSINESS THAT MY FATHER CARRIES ON TODAY I NEVER SAW THIS GREATUNCLE BUT IM SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE HIM WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE RATHER HARDBOILED PAINTING THAT HANGS IN FATHERS OFFICE I GRADUATED FROM NEW HAVEN IN JUST A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AFTER MY FATHER AND A LITTLE LATER I PARTICIPATED IN THAT DELAYED TEUTONIC MIGRATION KNOWN AS THE GREAT WAR I ENJOYED THE COUNTERRAID SO THOROUGHLY THAT I CAME BACK RESTLESS INSTEAD OF BEING THE WARM CENTRE OF THE WORLD THE MIDDLE WEST NOW SEEMED LIKE THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE SO I DECIDED TO GO EAST AND LEARN THE BOND BUSINESS EVERYBODY I KNEW WAS IN THE BOND BUSINESS SO I SUPPOSED IT COULD SUPPORT ONE MORE SINGLE MAN ALL MY AUNTS AND UNCLES TALKED IT OVER AS IF THEY WERE CHOOSING A PREP SCHOOL FOR ME AND FINALLY SAID WHY YEES WITH VERY GRAVE HESITANT FACES FATHER AGREED TO FINANCE ME FOR A YEAR AND AFTER VARIOUS DELAYS I CAME EAST PERMANENTLY I THOUGHT IN THE SPRING OF TWENTYTWO THE PRACTICAL THING WAS TO FIND ROOMS IN THE CITY BUT IT WAS A WARM SEASON AND I HAD JUST LEFT A COUNTRY OF WIDE LAWNS AND FRIENDLY TREES SO WHEN A YOUNG MAN AT THE OFFICE SUGGESTED THAT WE TAKE A HOUSE TOGETHER IN A COMMUTING TOWN IT SOUNDED LIKE A GREAT IDEA HE FOUND THE HOUSE A WEATHERBEATEN CARDBOARD BUNGALOW AT EIGHTY A MONTH BUT AT THE LAST MINUTE THE FIRM ORDERED HIM TO WASHINGTON AND I WENT OUT TO THE COUNTRY ALONE I HAD A DOG AT LEAST I HAD HIM FOR A FEW DAYS UNTIL HE RAN AWAY AND AN OLD DODGE AND A FINNISH WOMAN WHO MADE MY BED AND COOKED BREAKFAST AND MUTTERED FINNISH WISDOM TO HERSELF OVER THE ELECTRIC STOVE IT WAS LONELY FOR A DAY OR SO UNTIL ONE MORNING SOME MAN MORE RECENTLY ARRIVED THAN I STOPPED ME ON THE ROAD HOW DO YOU GET TO WEST EGG VILLAGE HE ASKED HELPLESSLY I TOLD HIM AND AS I WALKED ON I WAS LONELY NO LONGER I WAS A GUIDE A PATHFINDER AN ORIGINAL SETTLER HE HAD CASUALLY CONFERRED ON ME THE FREEDOM OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND SO WITH THE SUNSHINE AND THE GREAT BURSTS OF LEAVES GROWING ON THE TREES JUST AS THINGS GROW IN FAST MOVIES I HAD THAT FAMILIAR CONVICTION THAT LIFE WAS BEGINNING OVER AGAIN WITH THE SUMMER THERE WAS SO MUCH TO READ FOR ONE THING AND SO MUCH FINE HEALTH TO BE PULLED DOWN OUT OF THE YOUNG BREATHGIVING AIR I BOUGHT A DOZEN VOLUMES ON BANKING AND CREDIT AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND THEY STOOD ON MY SHELF IN RED AND GOLD LIKE NEW MONEY FROM THE MINT PROMISING TO UNFOLD THE SHINING SECRETS THAT ONLY MIDAS AND MORGAN AND MAECENAS KNEW AND I HAD THE HIGH INTENTION OF READING MANY OTHER BOOKS BESIDES I WAS RATHER LITERARY IN COLLEGE ONE YEAR I WROTE A SERIES OF VERY SOLEMN AND OBVIOUS EDITORIALS FOR THE YALE NEWS AND NOW I WAS GOING TO BRING BACK ALL SUCH THINGS INTO MY LIFE AND BECOME AGAIN THAT MOST LIMITED OF ALL SPECIALISTS THE WELLROUNDED MAN THIS ISNT JUST AN EPIGRAM LIFE IS MUCH MORE SUCCESSFULLY LOOKED AT FROM A SINGLE WINDOW AFTER ALL IT WAS A MATTER OF CHANCE THAT I SHOULD HAVE RENTED A HOUSE IN ONE OF THE STRANGEST COMMUNITIES IN NORTH AMERICA IT WAS ON THAT SLENDER RIOTOUS ISLAND WHICH EXTENDS ITSELF DUE EAST OF NEW YORK AND WHERE THERE ARE AMONG OTHER NATURAL CURIOSITIES TWO UNUSUAL FORMATIONS OF LAND TWENTY MILES FROM THE CITY A PAIR OF ENORMOUS EGGS IDENTICAL IN CONTOUR AND SEPARATED ONLY BY A COURTESY BAY JUT OUT INTO THE MOST DOMESTICATED BODY OF SALT WATER IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE THE GREAT WET BARNYARD OF LONG ISLAND SOUND THEY ARE NOT PERFECT OVALS LIKE THE EGG IN THE COLUMBUS STORY THEY ARE BOTH CRUSHED FLAT AT THE CONTACT END BUT THEIR PHYSICAL RESEMBLANCE MUST BE A SOURCE OF PERPETUAL WONDER TO THE GULLS THAT FLY OVERHEAD TO THE WINGLESS A MORE INTERESTING PHENOMENON IS THEIR DISSIMILARITY IN EVERY PARTICULAR EXCEPT SHAPE AND SIZE I LIVED AT WEST EGG THE WELL THE LESS FASHIONABLE OF THE TWO THOUGH THIS IS A MOST SUPERFICIAL TAG TO EXPRESS THE BIZARRE AND NOT A LITTLE SINISTER CONTRAST BETWEEN THEM MY HOUSE WAS AT THE VERY TIP OF THE EGG ONLY FIFTY YARDS FROM THE SOUND AND SQUEEZED BETWEEN TWO HUGE PLACES THAT RENTED FOR TWELVE OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND A SEASON THE ONE ON MY RIGHT WAS A COLOSSAL AFFAIR BY ANY STANDARD IT WAS A FACTUAL IMITATION OF SOME HôTEL DE VILLE IN NORMANDY WITH A TOWER ON ONE SIDE SPANKING NEW UNDER A THIN BEARD OF RAW IVY AND A MARBLE SWIMMING POOL AND MORE THAN FORTY ACRES OF LAWN AND GARDEN IT WAS GATSBYS MANSION OR RATHER AS I DIDNT KNOW MR GATSBY IT WAS A MANSION INHABITED BY A GENTLEMAN OF THAT NAME MY OWN HOUSE WAS AN EYESORE BUT IT WAS A SMALL EYESORE AND IT HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED SO I HAD A VIEW OF THE WATER A PARTIAL VIEW OF MY NEIGHBOURS LAWN AND THE CONSOLING PROXIMITY OF MILLIONAIRES ALL FOR EIGHTY DOLLARS A MONTH ACROSS THE COURTESY BAY THE WHITE PALACES OF FASHIONABLE EAST EGG GLITTERED ALONG THE WATER AND THE HISTORY OF THE SUMMER REALLY BEGINS ON THE EVENING I DROVE OVER THERE TO HAVE DINNER WITH THE TOM BUCHANANS DAISY WAS MY SECOND COUSIN ONCE REMOVED AND ID KNOWN TOM IN COLLEGE AND JUST AFTER THE WAR I SPENT TWO DAYS WITH THEM IN CHICAGO HER HUSBAND AMONG VARIOUS PHYSICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS HAD BEEN ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL ENDS THAT EVER PLAYED FOOTBALL AT NEW HAVEN A NATIONAL FIGURE IN A WAY ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO REACH SUCH AN ACUTE LIMITED EXCELLENCE AT TWENTYONE THAT EVERYTHING AFTERWARD SAVOURS OF ANTICLIMAX HIS FAMILY WERE ENORMOUSLY WEALTHY EVEN IN COLLEGE HIS FREEDOM WITH MONEY WAS A MATTER FOR REPROACH BUT NOW HED LEFT CHICAGO AND COME EAST IN A FASHION THAT RATHER TOOK YOUR BREATH AWAY FOR INSTANCE HED BROUGHT DOWN A STRING OF POLO PONIES FROM LAKE FOREST IT WAS HARD TO REALIZE THAT A MAN IN MY OWN GENERATION WAS WEALTHY ENOUGH TO DO THAT WHY THEY CAME EAST I DONT KNOW THEY HAD SPENT A YEAR IN FRANCE FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON AND THEN DRIFTED HERE AND THERE UNRESTFULLY WHEREVER PEOPLE PLAYED POLO AND WERE RICH TOGETHER THIS WAS A PERMANENT MOVE SAID DAISY OVER THE TELEPHONE BUT I DIDNT BELIEVE IT I HAD NO SIGHT INTO DAISYS HEART BUT I FELT THAT TOM WOULD DRIFT ON FOREVER SEEKING A LITTLE WISTFULLY FOR THE DRAMATIC TURBULENCE OF SOME IRRECOVERABLE FOOTBALL GAME AND SO IT HAPPENED THAT ON A WARM WINDY EVENING I DROVE OVER TO EAST EGG TO SEE TWO OLD FRIENDS WHOM I SCARCELY KNEW AT ALL THEIR HOUSE WAS EVEN MORE ELABORATE THAN I EXPECTED A CHEERFUL REDANDWHITE GEORGIAN COLONIAL MANSION OVERLOOKING THE BAY THE LAWN STARTED AT THE BEACH AND RAN TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR FOR A QUARTER OF A MILE JUMPING OVER SUNDIALS AND BRICK WALKS AND BURNING GARDENS FINALLY WHEN IT REACHED THE HOUSE DRIFTING UP THE SIDE IN BRIGHT VINES AS THOUGH FROM THE MOMENTUM OF ITS RUN THE FRONT WAS BROKEN BY A LINE OF FRENCH WINDOWS GLOWING NOW WITH REFLECTED GOLD AND WIDE OPEN TO THE WARM WINDY AFTERNOON AND TOM BUCHANAN IN RIDING CLOTHES WAS STANDING WITH HIS LEGS APART ON THE FRONT PORCH HE HAD CHANGED SINCE HIS NEW HAVEN YEARS NOW HE WAS A STURDY STRAWHAIRED MAN OF THIRTY WITH A RATHER HARD MOUTH AND A SUPERCILIOUS MANNER TWO SHINING ARROGANT EYES HAD ESTABLISHED DOMINANCE OVER HIS FACE AND GAVE HIM THE APPEARANCE OF ALWAYS LEANING AGGRESSIVELY FORWARD NOT EVEN THE EFFEMINATE SWANK OF HIS RIDING CLOTHES COULD HIDE THE ENORMOUS POWER OF THAT BODY HE SEEMED TO FILL THOSE GLISTENING BOOTS UNTIL HE STRAINED THE TOP LACING AND YOU COULD SEE A GREAT PACK OF MUSCLE SHIFTING WHEN HIS SHOULDER MOVED UNDER HIS THIN COAT IT WAS A BODY CAPABLE OF ENORMOUS LEVERAGE A CRUEL BODY HIS SPEAKING VOICE A GRUFF HUSKY TENOR ADDED TO THE IMPRESSION OF FRACTIOUSNESS HE CONVEYED THERE WAS A TOUCH OF PATERNAL CONTEMPT IN IT EVEN TOWARD PEOPLE HE LIKED AND THERE WERE MEN AT NEW HAVEN WHO HAD HATED HIS GUTS NOW DONT THINK MY OPINION ON THESE MATTERS IS FINAL HE SEEMED TO SAY JUST BECAUSE IM STRONGER AND MORE OF A MAN THAN YOU ARE WE WERE IN THE SAME SENIOR SOCIETY AND WHILE WE WERE NEVER INTIMATE I ALWAYS HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT HE APPROVED OF ME AND WANTED ME TO LIKE HIM WITH SOME HARSH DEFIANT WISTFULNESS OF HIS OWN WE TALKED FOR A FEW MINUTES ON THE SUNNY PORCH IVE GOT A NICE PLACE HERE HE SAID HIS EYES FLASHING ABOUT RESTLESSLY TURNING ME AROUND BY ONE ARM HE MOVED A BROAD FLAT HAND ALONG THE FRONT VISTA INCLUDING IN ITS SWEEP A SUNKEN ITALIAN GARDEN A HALF ACRE OF DEEP PUNGENT ROSES AND A SNUBNOSED MOTORBOAT THAT BUMPED THE TIDE OFFSHORE IT BELONGED TO DEMAINE THE OIL MAN HE TURNED ME AROUND AGAIN POLITELY AND ABRUPTLY WELL GO INSIDE WE WALKED THROUGH A HIGH HALLWAY INTO A BRIGHT ROSYCOLOURED SPACE FRAGILELY BOUND INTO THE HOUSE BY FRENCH WINDOWS AT EITHER END THE WINDOWS WERE AJAR AND GLEAMING WHITE AGAINST THE FRESH GRASS OUTSIDE THAT SEEMED TO GROW A LITTLE WAY INTO THE HOUSE A BREEZE BLEW THROUGH THE ROOM BLEW CURTAINS IN AT ONE END AND OUT THE OTHER LIKE PALE FLAGS TWISTING THEM UP TOWARD THE FROSTED WEDDINGCAKE OF THE CEILING AND THEN RIPPLED OVER THE WINECOLOURED RUG MAKING A SHADOW ON IT AS WIND DOES ON THE SEA THE ONLY COMPLETELY STATIONARY OBJECT IN THE ROOM WAS AN ENORMOUS COUCH ON WHICH TWO YOUNG WOMEN WERE BUOYED UP AS THOUGH UPON AN ANCHORED BALLOON THEY WERE BOTH IN WHITE AND THEIR DRESSES WERE RIPPLING AND FLUTTERING AS IF THEY HAD JUST BEEN BLOWN BACK IN AFTER A SHORT FLIGHT AROUND THE HOUSE I MUST HAVE STOOD FOR A FEW MOMENTS LISTENING TO THE WHIP AND SNAP OF THE CURTAINS AND THE GROAN OF A PICTURE ON THE WALL THEN THERE WAS A BOOM AS TOM BUCHANAN SHUT THE REAR WINDOWS AND THE CAUGHT WIND DIED OUT ABOUT THE ROOM AND THE CURTAINS AND THE RUGS AND THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN BALLOONED SLOWLY TO THE FLOOR THE YOUNGER OF THE TWO WAS A STRANGER TO ME SHE WAS EXTENDED FULL LENGTH AT HER END OF THE DIVAN COMPLETELY MOTIONLESS AND WITH HER CHIN RAISED A LITTLE AS IF SHE WERE BALANCING SOMETHING ON IT WHICH WAS QUITE LIKELY TO FALL IF SHE SAW ME OUT OF THE CORNER OF HER EYES SHE GAVE NO HINT OF IT INDEED I WAS ALMOST SURPRISED INTO MURMURING AN APOLOGY FOR HAVING DISTURBED HER BY COMING IN THE OTHER GIRL DAISY MADE AN ATTEMPT TO RISE SHE LEANED SLIGHTLY FORWARD WITH A CONSCIENTIOUS EXPRESSION THEN SHE LAUGHED AN ABSURD CHARMING LITTLE LAUGH AND I LAUGHED TOO AND CAME FORWARD INTO THE ROOM IM PPARALYSED WITH HAPPINESS SHE LAUGHED AGAIN AS IF SHE SAID SOMETHING VERY WITTY AND HELD MY HAND FOR A MOMENT LOOKING UP INTO MY FACE PROMISING THAT THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WORLD SHE SO MUCH WANTED TO SEE THAT WAS A WAY SHE HAD SHE HINTED IN A MURMUR THAT THE SURNAME OF THE BALANCING GIRL WAS BAKER IVE HEARD IT SAID THAT DAISYS MURMUR WAS ONLY TO MAKE PEOPLE LEAN TOWARD HER AN IRRELEVANT CRITICISM THAT MADE IT NO LESS CHARMING AT ANY RATE MISS BAKERS LIPS FLUTTERED SHE NODDED AT ME ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY AND THEN QUICKLY TIPPED HER HEAD BACK AGAIN THE OBJECT SHE WAS BALANCING HAD OBVIOUSLY TOTTERED A LITTLE AND GIVEN HER SOMETHING OF A FRIGHT AGAIN A SORT OF APOLOGY AROSE TO MY LIPS ALMOST ANY EXHIBITION OF COMPLETE SELFSUFFICIENCY DRAWS A STUNNED TRIBUTE FROM ME I LOOKED BACK AT MY COUSIN WHO BEGAN TO ASK ME QUESTIONS IN HER LOW THRILLING VOICE IT WAS THE KIND OF VOICE THAT THE EAR FOLLOWS UP AND DOWN AS IF EACH SPEECH IS AN ARRANGEMENT OF NOTES THAT WILL NEVER BE PLAYED AGAIN HER FACE WAS SAD AND LOVELY WITH BRIGHT THINGS IN IT BRIGHT EYES AND A BRIGHT PASSIONATE MOUTH BUT THERE WAS AN EXCITEMENT IN HER VOICE THAT MEN WHO HAD CARED FOR HER FOUND DIFFICULT TO FORGET A SINGING COMPULSION A WHISPERED LISTEN A PROMISE THAT SHE HAD DONE GAY EXCITING THINGS JUST A WHILE SINCE AND THAT THERE WERE GAY EXCITING THINGS HOVERING IN THE NEXT HOUR I TOLD HER HOW I HAD STOPPED OFF IN CHICAGO FOR A DAY ON MY WAY EAST AND HOW A DOZEN PEOPLE HAD SENT THEIR LOVE THROUGH ME DO THEY MISS ME SHE CRIED ECSTATICALLY THE WHOLE TOWN IS DESOLATE ALL THE CARS HAVE THE LEFT REAR WHEEL PAINTED BLACK AS A

INCONSEQUENCE THAT WAS NEVER QUITE CHATTER THAT WAS AS COOL AS THEIR WHITE DRESSES AND THEIR IMPERSONAL EYES IN THE ABSENCE OF ALL DESIRE THEY WERE HERE AND THEY ACCEPTED TOM AND ME MAKING ONLY A POLITE PLEASANT EFFORT TO ENTERTAIN OR TO BE ENTERTAINED THEY KNEW THAT PRESENTLY DINNER WOULD BE OVER AND A LITTLE LATER THE EVENING TOO WOULD BE OVER AND CASUALLY PUT AWAY IT WAS SHARPLY DIFFERENT

FLOWED FROM HER AS IF HER HEART WAS TRYING TO COME OUT TO YOU CONCEALED IN ONE OF THOSE BREATHLESS THRILLING WORDS THEN SUDDENLY SHE THREW HER NAPKIN ON THE TABLE AND EXCUSED HERSELF AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE MISS BAKER AND I EXCHANGED A SHORT GLANCE CONSCIOUSLY DEVOID OF MEANING I WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WHEN SHE SAT UP ALERTLY AND SAID SH IN A WARNING VOICE A SUBDUED IMPASSIONED MURMUR WAS AUDIBLE IN

FIVE MINUTES AT TABLE I REMEMBER THE CANDLES BEING LIT AGAIN POINTLESSLY AND I WAS CONSCIOUS OF WANTING TO LOOK SQUARELY AT EVERYONE AND YET TO AVOID ALL EYES I COULDNT GUESS WHAT DAISY AND TOM WERE THINKING BUT I DOUBT IF EVEN MISS BAKER WHO SEEMED TO HAVE MASTERED A CERTAIN HARDY SCEPTICISM WAS ABLE UTTERLY TO PUT THIS FIFTH GUESTS SHRILL METALLIC URGENCY OUT OF MIND TO A CERTAIN TEMPERAMENT THE SITUATION MIGHT HAVE SEEMED INTRIGUING MY OWN INSTINCT WAS TO TELEPHONE IMMEDIATELY FOR THE POLICE THE HORSES NEEDLESS TO SAY WERE NOT MENTIONED AGAIN TOM AND MISS BAKER WITH SEVERAL FEET OF TWILIGHT BETWEEN THEM STROLLED BACK INTO THE LIBRARY AS IF TO A VIGIL BESIDE A PERFECTLY TANGIBLE BODY WHILE TRYING TO LOOK PLEASANTLY INTERESTED AND A LITTLE DEAF I FOLLOWED DAISY AROUND A CHAIN OF CONNECTING VERANDAS TO THE PORCH IN FRONT IN ITS DEEP GLOOM WE SAT DOWN SIDE BY SIDE ON A WICKER SETTEE DAISY TOOK HER FACE IN HER HANDS AS IF FEELING ITS LOVELY SHAPE AND HER EYES MOVED GRADUALLY OUT

UNEASY AS THOUGH THE WHOLE EVENING HAD BEEN A TRICK OF SOME SORT TO EXACT A CONTRIBUTORY EMOTION FROM ME I WAITED AND SURE ENOUGH IN A MOMENT SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH AN ABSOLUTE SMIRK ON HER LOVELY FACE AS IF SHE HAD ASSERTED HER MEMBERSHIP IN A RATHER DISTINGUISHED SECRET SOCIETY TO WHICH SHE AND TOM BELONGED INSIDE THE CRIMSON ROOM BLOOMED WITH LIGHT TOM AND MISS BAKER SAT AT EITHER END OF THE LONG COUCH AND SHE READ ALOUD TO HIM FROM THE SATURDAY EVENING POST THE WORDS MURMUROUS AND UNINFLECTED RUNNING TOGETHER IN A SOOTHING TUNE THE LAMPLIGHT BRIGHT ON HIS BOOTS AND DULL ON THE AUTUMNLEAF YELLOW OF HER HAIR GLINTED ALONG THE PAPER AS SHE TURNED A PAGE WITH A FLUTTER OF SLENDER MUSCLES IN HER ARMS WHEN WE CAME IN SHE HELD US SILENT FOR A MOMENT WITH A LIFTED HAND TO BE CONTINUED SHE

IMPORTANT WE HEARD YOU WERE ENGAGED TO A GIRL OUT WEST THATS RIGHT CORROBORATED TOM KINDLY WE HEARD THAT YOU WERE ENGAGED ITS A LIBEL IM TOO POOR BUT WE HEARD IT INSISTED DAISY SURPRISING ME BY OPENING UP AGAIN IN A FLOWERLIKE WAY WE HEARD IT FROM THREE PEOPLE SO IT MUST BE TRUE OF COURSE I KNEW WHAT THEY WERE REFERRING TO BUT I WASNT EVEN VAGUELY ENGAGED THE FACT THAT GOSSIP HAD PUBLISHED THE BANNS WAS ONE OF THE REASONS I HAD COME EAST YOU CANT STOP GOING WITH AN OLD FRIEND ON ACCOUNT OF RUMOURS AND ON THE OTHER HAND I HAD NO INTENTION OF BEING RUMOURED INTO MARRIAGE THEIR INTEREST RATHER TOUCHED ME AND MADE THEM LESS REMOTELY RICH NEVERTHELESS I WAS CONFUSED AND A LITTLE DISGUSTED AS I DROVE AWAY IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE THING FOR DAISY TO DO WAS TO RUSH OUT OF THE HOUSE CHILD IN ARMS BUT APPARENTLY THERE WERE NO SUCH INTENTIONS IN HER HEAD AS FOR TOM THE FACT THAT HE HAD SOME WOMAN IN NEW YORK WAS REALLY LESS SURPRISING THAN THAT HE HAD BEEN DEPRESSED BY A BOOK SOMETHING WAS MAKING HIM NIBBLE AT THE EDGE OF STALE IDEAS AS IF HIS STURDY PHYSICAL EGOTISM NO LONGER NOURISHED HIS PEREMPTORY HEART ALREADY IT WAS DEEP SUMMER ON ROADHOUSE ROOFS AND IN FRONT OF WAYSIDE GARAGES WHERE NEW RED PETROLPUMPS SAT OUT IN POOLS OF LIGHT AND WHEN I REACHED MY ESTATE AT WEST EGG I RAN THE CAR UNDER ITS SHED AND SAT FOR A WHILE ON AN ABANDONED GRASS ROLLER IN THE YARD THE WIND HAD BLOWN OFF LEAVING A LOUD BRIGHT NIGHT WITH WINGS BEATING IN THE TREES AND A PERSISTENT ORGAN SOUND AS THE FULL BELLOWS OF THE EARTH BLEW THE FROGS FULL OF LIFE THE SILHOUETTE OF A MOVING CAT WAVERED ACROSS THE MOONLIGHT AND TURNING MY HEAD TO WATCH IT I SAW THAT I WAS NOT ALONE FIFTY FEET AWAY A FIGURE HAD EMERGED FROM THE SHADOW OF MY NEIGHBOURS MANSION AND WAS STANDING WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS REGARDING THE SILVER PEPPER OF THE STARS SOMETHING IN HIS LEISURELY MOVEMENTS AND THE SECURE POSITION OF HIS FEET UPON THE LAWN SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS MR GATSBY HIMSELF COME OUT TO DETERMINE WHAT SHARE WAS HIS OF OUR LOCAL HEAVENS I DECIDED TO CALL TO HIM MISS BAKER HAD MENTIONED HIM AT DINNER AND THAT WOULD DO FOR AN INTRODUCTION BUT I DIDNT CALL TO HIM FOR HE GAVE A SUDDEN INTIMATION THAT HE WAS CONTENT TO BE ALONE HE STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS TOWARD THE DARK WATER IN A CURIOUS WAY AND FAR AS I WAS FROM HIM I COULD HAVE SWORN HE WAS TREMBLING INVOLUNTARILY I GLANCED SEAWARD AND DISTINGUISHED NOTHING EXCEPT A SINGLE GREEN LIGHT MINUTE AND FAR AWAY THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE END OF A DOCK WHEN I LOOKED ONCE MORE FOR GATSBY HE HAD VANISHED AND I WAS ALONE AGAIN IN THE UNQUIET DARKNESS II ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN WEST EGG AND NEW YORK THE MOTOR ROAD HASTILY JOINS THE RAILROAD AND RUNS BESIDE IT FOR A QUARTER OF A MILE SO AS TO SHRINK AWAY FROM A CERTAIN DESOLATE AREA OF LAND THIS IS A VALLEY OF ASHES A FANTASTIC FARM WHERE ASHES GROW LIKE WHEAT INTO RIDGES AND HILLS AND GROTESQUE GARDENS WHERE ASHES TAKE THE FORMS OF HOUSES AND CHIMNEYS AND RISING SMOKE AND FINALLY WITH A TRANSCENDENT EFFORT OF ASHGREY MEN WHO MOVE DIMLY AND ALREADY CRUMBLING THROUGH THE POWDERY AIR OCCASIONALLY A LINE OF GREY CARS CRAWLS ALONG AN INVISIBLE TRACK GIVES OUT A GHASTLY CREAK AND COMES TO REST AND IMMEDIATELY THE ASHGREY MEN SWARM UP WITH LEADEN SPADES AND STIR UP AN IMPENETRABLE CLOUD WHICH SCREENS THEIR OBSCURE OPERATIONS FROM YOUR SIGHT BUT ABOVE THE GREY LAND AND THE SPASMS OF BLEAK DUST WHICH DRIFT ENDLESSLY OVER IT YOU PERCEIVE AFTER A MOMENT THE EYES OF DOCTOR T J ECKLEBURG THE EYES OF DOCTOR T J ECKLEBURG ARE BLUE AND GIGANTIC THEIR RETINAS ARE ONE YARD HIGH THEY LOOK OUT OF NO FACE BUT INSTEAD FROM A PAIR OF ENORMOUS YELLOW SPECTACLES WHICH PASS OVER A NONEXISTENT NOSE EVIDENTLY SOME WILD WAG OF AN OCULIST SET THEM THERE TO FATTEN HIS PRACTICE IN THE BOROUGH OF QUEENS AND THEN SANK DOWN HIMSELF INTO ETERNAL BLINDNESS OR FORGOT THEM AND MOVED AWAY BUT HIS EYES DIMMED A LITTLE BY MANY PAINTLESS DAYS UNDER SUN AND RAIN BROOD ON OVER THE SOLEMN DUMPING GROUND THE VALLEY OF ASHES IS BOUNDED ON ONE SIDE BY A SMALL FOUL RIVER AND WHEN THE DRAWBRIDGE IS UP TO LET BARGES THROUGH THE PASSENGERS ON WAITING TRAINS CAN STARE AT THE DISMAL SCENE FOR AS LONG AS HALF AN HOUR THERE IS ALWAYS A HALT THERE OF AT LEAST A MINUTE AND IT WAS BECAUSE OF THIS THAT I FIRST MET TOM BUCHANANS MISTRESS THE FACT THAT HE HAD ONE WAS INSISTED UPON WHEREVER HE WAS KNOWN HIS ACQUAINTANCES RESENTED THE FACT THAT HE TURNED UP IN POPULAR CAFéS WITH HER AND LEAVING HER AT A TABLE SAUNTERED ABOUT CHATTING WITH WHOMSOEVER HE KNEW THOUGH I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE HER I HAD NO DESIRE TO MEET HER BUT I DID I WENT UP TO NEW YORK WITH TOM ON THE TRAIN ONE AFTERNOON AND WHEN WE STOPPED BY THE ASHHEAPS HE JUMPED TO HIS FEET AND TAKING HOLD OF MY ELBOW LITERALLY FORCED ME FROM THE CAR WERE GETTING OFF HE INSISTED I WANT YOU TO MEET MY GIRL I THINK HED TANKED UP A GOOD DEAL AT LUNCHEON AND HIS DETERMINATION TO HAVE MY COMPANY BORDERED ON VIOLENCE THE SUPERCILIOUS ASSUMPTION WAS THAT ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON I HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO I FOLLOWED HIM OVER A LOW WHITEWASHED RAILROAD FENCE AND WE WALKED BACK A HUNDRED YARDS ALONG THE ROAD UNDER DOCTOR ECKLEBURGS PERSISTENT STARE THE ONLY BUILDING IN SIGHT WAS A SMALL BLOCK OF YELLOW BRICK SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THE WASTE LAND A SORT OF COMPACT MAIN STREET MINISTERING TO IT AND CONTIGUOUS TO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ONE OF THE THREE SHOPS IT CONTAINED WAS FOR RENT AND ANOTHER WAS AN ALLNIGHT RESTAURANT APPROACHED BY A TRAIL OF ASHES THE THIRD WAS A GARAGE REPAIRS GEORGE B WILSON CARS BOUGHT AND SOLD AND I FOLLOWED TOM INSIDE THE INTERIOR WAS UNPROSPEROUS AND BARE THE ONLY CAR VISIBLE WAS THE DUSTCOVERED WRECK OF A FORD WHICH CROUCHED IN A DIM CORNER IT HAD OCCURRED TO ME THAT THIS SHADOW OF A GARAGE MUST BE A BLIND AND THAT SUMPTUOUS AND ROMANTIC APARTMENTS WERE CONCEALED OVERHEAD WHEN THE PROPRIETOR HIMSELF APPEARED IN THE DOOR OF AN OFFICE WIPING HIS HANDS ON A PIECE OF WASTE HE WAS A BLOND SPIRITLESS MAN ANAEMIC AND FAINTLY HANDSOME WHEN HE SAW US A DAMP GLEAM OF HOPE SPRANG INTO HIS LIGHT BLUE EYES HELLO WILSON OLD MAN SAID TOM SLAPPING HIM JOVIALLY ON THE SHOULDER HOWS BUSINESS I CANT COMPLAIN ANSWERED WILSON UNCONVINCINGLY WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO SELL ME THAT CAR NEXT WEEK IVE GOT MY MAN WORKING ON IT NOW WORKS PRETTY SLOW DONT HE NO HE DOESNT SAID TOM COLDLY AND IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT IT MAYBE ID BETTER SELL IT SOMEWHERE ELSE AFTER ALL I DONT MEAN THAT EXPLAINED WILSON QUICKLY I JUST MEANT HIS VOICE FADED OFF AND TOM GLANCED IMPATIENTLY AROUND THE GARAGE THEN I HEARD FOOTSTEPS ON A STAIRS AND IN A MOMENT THE THICKISH FIGURE OF A WOMAN BLOCKED OUT THE LIGHT FROM THE OFFICE DOOR SHE WAS IN THE MIDDLE THIRTIES AND FAINTLY STOUT BUT SHE CARRIED HER FLESH SENSUOUSLY AS SOME WOMEN CAN HER FACE ABOVE A SPOTTED DRESS OF DARK BLUE CRêPEDECHINE CONTAINED NO FACET OR GLEAM OF BEAUTY BUT THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATELY PERCEPTIBLE VITALITY ABOUT HER AS IF THE NERVES OF HER BODY WERE CONTINUALLY SMOULDERING SHE SMILED SLOWLY AND WALKING THROUGH HER HUSBAND AS IF HE WERE A GHOST SHOOK HANDS WITH TOM LOOKING HIM FLUSH IN THE EYE THEN SHE WET HER LIPS AND WITHOUT TURNING AROUND SPOKE TO HER HUSBAND IN A SOFT COARSE VOICE GET SOME CHAIRS WHY DONT YOU SO SOMEBODY CAN SIT DOWN OH SURE AGREED WILSON HURRIEDLY AND WENT TOWARD THE LITTLE OFFICE MINGLING IMMEDIATELY WITH THE CEMENT COLOUR OF THE WALLS A WHITE ASHEN DUST VEILED HIS DARK SUIT AND HIS PALE HAIR AS IT VEILED EVERYTHING IN THE VICINITY EXCEPT HIS WIFE WHO MOVED CLOSE TO TOM I WANT TO SEE YOU SAID TOM INTENTLY GET ON THE NEXT TRAIN ALL RIGHT ILL MEET YOU BY THE NEWSSTAND ON THE LOWER LEVEL SHE NODDED AND MOVED AWAY FROM HIM JUST AS GEORGE WILSON EMERGED WITH TWO CHAIRS FROM HIS OFFICE DOOR WE WAITED FOR HER DOWN THE ROAD

ELEVATOR AND OF COURSE I GOT TO CALL UP MY SISTER TOO THE APARTMENT WAS ON THE TOP FLOOR A SMALL LIVINGROOM A SMALL DININGROOM A SMALL BEDROOM AND A BATH THE LIVINGROOM WAS CROWDED TO THE DOORS WITH A SET OF TAPESTRIED FURNITURE ENTIRELY TOO LARGE FOR IT SO THAT TO MOVE ABOUT WAS TO STUMBLE CONTINUALLY OVER SCENES OF LADIES SWINGING IN THE GARDENS OF VERSAILLES THE ONLY PICTURE WAS AN OVERENLARGED PHOTOGRAPH APPARENTLY A HEN SITTING ON A BLURRED ROCK LOOKED AT FROM A DISTANCE HOWEVER THE HEN RESOLVED ITSELF INTO A BONNET AND THE COUNTENANCE OF A STOUT OLD LADY BEAMED DOWN INTO THE ROOM SEVERAL OLD COPIES OF TOWN TATTLE LAY ON THE TABLE TOGETHER WITH A COPY OF SIMON CALLED PETER AND SOME OF THE SMALL SCANDAL MAGAZINES OF BROADWAY MRS WILSON WAS FIRST CONCERNED WITH THE DOG A RELUCTANT ELEVATOR BOY WENT FOR A BOX FULL OF STRAW AND SOME MILK TO WHICH HE ADDED ON HIS OWN INITIATIVE A TIN OF LARGE HARD DOG BISCUITS ONE OF WHICH DECOMPOSED APATHETICALLY IN THE SAUCER OF MILK ALL AFTERNOON MEANWHILE TOM BROUGHT OUT A BOTTLE OF WHISKY FROM A LOCKED BUREAU DOOR I HAVE BEEN DRUNK JUST TWICE IN MY LIFE AND THE SECOND TIME WAS THAT AFTERNOON SO EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED HAS A DIM HAZY CAST OVER IT ALTHOUGH UNTIL AFTER EIGHT OCLOCK THE APARTMENT WAS FULL OF CHEERFUL SUN SITTING ON TOMS LAP MRS WILSON CALLED UP SEVERAL PEOPLE ON THE TELEPHONE THEN THERE WERE NO CIGARETTES AND I WENT OUT TO BUY SOME AT THE DRUGSTORE ON THE CORNER WHEN I CAME BACK THEY HAD BOTH DISAPPEARED SO I SAT DOWN DISCREETLY IN THE LIVINGROOM AND READ A CHAPTER OF SIMON CALLED PETER EITHER IT WAS

INCESSANT CLICKING AS INNUMERABLE POTTERY BRACELETS JINGLED UP AND DOWN UPON HER ARMS SHE CAME IN WITH SUCH A PROPRIETARY HASTE AND LOOKED AROUND SO POSSESSIVELY AT THE FURNITURE THAT I WONDERED IF

AFTERNOON DRESS OF CREAMCOLOURED CHIFFON WHICH GAVE OUT A CONTINUAL RUSTLE AS SHE SWEPT ABOUT THE ROOM WITH THE INFLUENCE OF THE DRESS HER PERSONALITY HAD ALSO UNDERGONE A CHANGE THE INTENSE VITALITY

AND WAITING FOR THE FOUR OCLOCK TRAIN III THERE WAS MUSIC FROM MY NEIGHBOURS HOUSE THROUGH THE SUMMER NIGHTS IN HIS BLUE GARDENS MEN AND GIRLS CAME AND WENT LIKE MOTHS AMONG THE WHISPERINGS AND THE CHAMPAGNE AND THE STARS AT HIGH TIDE IN THE AFTERNOON I WATCHED HIS GUESTS DIVING FROM THE TOWER OF HIS RAFT OR TAKING THE SUN ON THE HOT SAND OF HIS BEACH WHILE HIS TWO MOTORBOATS SLIT THE WATERS OF THE SOUND DRAWING AQUAPLANES OVER CATARACTS OF FOAM ON WEEKENDS HIS ROLLSROYCE BECAME AN OMNIBUS BEARING PARTIES TO AND FROM THE CITY BETWEEN NINE IN THE MORNING AND LONG PAST MIDNIGHT WHILE HIS STATION WAGON SCAMPERED LIKE A BRISK YELLOW BUG TO MEET ALL TRAINS AND ON MONDAYS EIGHT SERVANTS INCLUDING AN EXTRA GARDENER TOILED ALL DAY WITH MOPS AND SCRUBBINGBRUSHES AND HAMMERS AND GARDENSHEARS REPAIRING THE RAVAGES OF THE NIGHT BEFORE EVERY FRIDAY FIVE CRATES OF ORANGES AND LEMONS ARRIVED FROM A FRUITERER IN NEW YORK EVERY MONDAY THESE SAME ORANGES AND LEMONS LEFT HIS BACK DOOR IN A PYRAMID OF PULPLESS HALVES THERE WAS A MACHINE IN THE KITCHEN WHICH COULD EXTRACT THE JUICE OF TWO HUNDRED ORANGES IN HALF AN HOUR IF A LITTLE BUTTON WAS PRESSED TWO HUNDRED TIMES BY A BUTLERS THUMB AT LEAST ONCE A FORTNIGHT A CORPS OF CATERERS CAME DOWN WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET OF CANVAS AND ENOUGH COLOURED LIGHTS TO MAKE A CHRISTMAS TREE OF GATSBYS ENORMOUS GARDEN ON BUFFET TABLES GARNISHED WITH GLISTENING HORSDOEUVRE SPICED BAKED HAMS CROWDED AGAINST SALADS OF HARLEQUIN DESIGNS AND PASTRY PIGS AND TURKEYS BEWITCHED TO A DARK GOLD IN THE MAIN HALL A BAR WITH A REAL BRASS RAIL WAS SET UP AND STOCKED WITH GINS AND LIQUORS AND WITH CORDIALS SO LONG FORGOTTEN THAT MOST OF HIS FEMALE GUESTS WERE TOO YOUNG TO KNOW ONE FROM ANOTHER BY SEVEN OCLOCK THE ORCHESTRA HAS ARRIVED NO THIN FIVEPIECE AFFAIR BUT A WHOLE PITFUL OF OBOES AND TROMBONES AND SAXOPHONES AND VIOLS AND CORNETS AND PICCOLOS AND LOW AND HIGH DRUMS THE LAST SWIMMERS HAVE COME IN FROM THE BEACH NOW AND ARE DRESSING UPSTAIRS

OF CASTILE THE BAR IS IN FULL SWING AND FLOATING ROUNDS OF COCKTAILS PERMEATE THE GARDEN OUTSIDE UNTIL THE AIR IS ALIVE WITH CHATTER AND LAUGHTER AND CASUAL INNUENDO AND INTRODUCTIONS FORGOTTEN ON THE SPOT AND ENTHUSIASTIC MEETINGS BETWEEN WOMEN WHO NEVER KNEW EACH OTHERS NAMES THE LIGHTS GROW BRIGHTER AS THE EARTH LURCHES AWAY FROM THE SUN AND NOW THE ORCHESTRA IS PLAYING YELLOW COCKTAIL MUSIC AND THE OPERA OF VOICES PITCHES A KEY HIGHER LAUGHTER IS EASIER MINUTE BY MINUTE SPILLED WITH PRODIGALITY TIPPED OUT AT A CHEERFUL WORD THE GROUPS CHANGE MORE SWIFTLY SWELL WITH NEW ARRIVALS DISSOLVE AND FORM IN THE SAME BREATH ALREADY THERE ARE WANDERERS CONFIDENT GIRLS WHO WEAVE HERE AND THERE AMONG THE STOUTER AND MORE STABLE BECOME FOR A SHARP JOYOUS MOMENT THE CENTRE OF A GROUP AND THEN EXCITED WITH TRIUMPH GLIDE ON THROUGH THE SEACHANGE OF FACES AND VOICES AND COLOUR UNDER THE CONSTANTLY CHANGING LIGHT SUDDENLY ONE OF THESE GYPSIES IN TREMBLING OPAL SEIZES A COCKTAIL OUT OF THE AIR DUMPS IT DOWN FOR COURAGE AND MOVING HER HANDS LIKE FRISCO DANCES OUT ALONE ON THE CANVAS PLATFORM A MOMENTARY HUSH THE ORCHESTRA LEADER VARIES HIS RHYTHM OBLIGINGLY FOR HER AND THERE IS A BURST OF CHATTER AS THE ERRONEOUS NEWS GOES AROUND THAT SHE IS GILDA GRAYS UNDERSTUDY FROM THE FOLLIES THE PARTY HAS BEGUN I BELIEVE THAT ON THE FIRST NIGHT I WENT TO GATSBYS HOUSE I WAS ONE OF THE FEW GUESTS WHO HAD ACTUALLY BEEN INVITED PEOPLE WERE NOT INVITED THEY WENT THERE THEY GOT INTO AUTOMOBILES WHICH BORE THEM OUT TO LONG ISLAND AND SOMEHOW THEY ENDED UP AT GATSBYS DOOR ONCE THERE THEY WERE INTRODUCED BY

TO FIND MY HOST BUT THE TWO OR THREE PEOPLE OF WHOM I ASKED HIS WHEREABOUTS STARED AT ME IN SUCH AN AMAZED WAY AND DENIED SO VEHEMENTLY ANY KNOWLEDGE OF HIS MOVEMENTS THAT I SLUNK OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COCKTAIL TABLE THE ONLY PLACE IN THE GARDEN WHERE A SINGLE MAN COULD LINGER WITHOUT LOOKING PURPOSELESS AND ALONE I WAS ON MY WAY TO GET ROARING DRUNK FROM SHEER EMBARRASSMENT WHEN JORDAN BAKER CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND STOOD AT THE HEAD OF THE MARBLE STEPS LEANING A LITTLE BACKWARD AND LOOKING WITH CONTEMPTUOUS INTEREST DOWN INTO THE GARDEN WELCOME OR NOT I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO ATTACH

THE NUMBERS PEOPLE WERE DOING STUNTS ALL OVER THE GARDEN WHILE HAPPY VACUOUS BURSTS OF LAUGHTER ROSE TOWARD THE SUMMER SKY A PAIR OF STAGE TWINS WHO TURNED OUT TO BE THE GIRLS IN YELLOW DID A BABY ACT IN COSTUME AND CHAMPAGNE WAS SERVED IN GLASSES BIGGER THAN FINGERBOWLS THE MOON HAD RISEN HIGHER AND FLOATING IN THE SOUND WAS A TRIANGLE OF SILVER SCALES TREMBLING A LITTLE TO THE STIFF TINNY DRIP OF THE BANJOES ON THE LAWN I WAS STILL WITH JORDAN BAKER WE WERE SITTING AT A TABLE WITH A MAN OF ABOUT MY AGE AND A ROWDY LITTLE GIRL WHO GAVE WAY UPON THE SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION TO UNCONTROLLABLE

IRRESISTIBLE PREJUDICE IN YOUR FAVOUR IT UNDERSTOOD YOU JUST SO FAR AS YOU WANTED TO BE UNDERSTOOD BELIEVED IN YOU AS YOU WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF AND ASSURED YOU THAT IT HAD PRECISELY THE IMPRESSION OF YOU THAT AT YOUR BEST YOU HOPED TO CONVEY PRECISELY AT THAT POINT IT VANISHED AND I WAS LOOKING AT AN ELEGANT YOUNG ROUGHNECK A YEAR OR TWO OVER THIRTY WHOSE ELABORATE FORMALITY OF SPEECH JUST MISSED BEING ABSURD SOME TIME BEFORE HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF ID GOT A STRONG IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS PICKING HIS WORDS WITH CARE ALMOST AT THE MOMENT WHEN MR GATSBY IDENTIFIED HIMSELF A BUTLER HURRIED TOWARD HIM WITH THE INFORMATION THAT CHICAGO WAS CALLING HIM ON THE WIRE HE EXCUSED HIMSELF WITH A SMALL BOW THAT INCLUDED EACH OF US IN TURN IF YOU WANT ANYTHING JUST ASK FOR IT OLD SPORT HE URGED ME EXCUSE ME I WILL REJOIN YOU LATER WHEN HE WAS GONE I TURNED IMMEDIATELY TO JORDAN CONSTRAINED TO ASSURE HER OF MY SURPRISE I HAD EXPECTED THAT MR GATSBY WOULD BE A FLORID AND

DONT THINK HE WENT THERE SOMETHING IN HER TONE REMINDED ME OF THE OTHER GIRLS I THINK HE KILLED A MAN AND HAD THE EFFECT OF STIMULATING MY CURIOSITY I WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED WITHOUT QUESTION THE INFORMATION THAT GATSBY SPRANG FROM THE SWAMPS OF LOUISIANA OR FROM THE LOWER EAST SIDE OF NEW YORK THAT WAS COMPREHENSIBLE BUT YOUNG MEN DIDNT AT LEAST IN MY PROVINCIAL INEXPERIENCE I BELIEVED THEY DIDNT DRIFT COOLLY OUT OF NOWHERE AND BUY A PALACE ON LONG ISLAND SOUND ANYHOW HE GIVES LARGE PARTIES SAID JORDAN CHANGING THE SUBJECT WITH AN URBAN DISTASTE FOR THE CONCRETE AND I LIKE LARGE PARTIES THEYRE SO INTIMATE AT SMALL PARTIES THERE ISNT ANY PRIVACY THERE WAS THE BOOM OF A BASS DRUM AND THE VOICE OF THE ORCHESTRA LEADER RANG OUT SUDDENLY ABOVE THE ECHOLALIA OF THE GARDEN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN HE CRIED AT THE REQUEST OF MR GATSBY WE ARE GOING TO PLAY FOR YOU MR VLADMIR TOSTOFFS LATEST WORK WHICH ATTRACTED SO MUCH ATTENTION AT CARNEGIE HALL LAST MAY IF YOU READ THE PAPERS YOU KNOW THERE WAS A BIG SENSATION HE SMILED WITH JOVIAL CONDESCENSION AND ADDED SOME SENSATION WHEREUPON EVERYBODY LAUGHED THE PIECE IS KNOWN HE CONCLUDED LUSTILY AS ‘VLADMIR TOSTOFFS JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD  THE NATURE OF MR TOSTOFFS COMPOSITION ELUDED ME BECAUSE JUST AS IT BEGAN MY EYES FELL ON GATSBY STANDING ALONE ON THE MARBLE STEPS AND LOOKING FROM ONE GROUP TO ANOTHER WITH APPROVING EYES HIS TANNED SKIN WAS DRAWN ATTRACTIVELY TIGHT ON HIS FACE AND HIS SHORT HAIR LOOKED AS THOUGH IT WERE TRIMMED EVERY DAY I COULD SEE NOTHING SINISTER ABOUT HIM I WONDERED IF THE FACT THAT HE WAS NOT DRINKING HELPED TO SET HIM OFF FROM HIS GUESTS FOR IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE GREW MORE CORRECT AS THE FRATERNAL HILARITY INCREASED WHEN THE JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAS OVER GIRLS WERE PUTTING THEIR HEADS ON MENS SHOULDERS IN A PUPPYISH CONVIVIAL WAY GIRLS WERE SWOONING BACKWARD PLAYFULLY INTO MENS ARMS EVEN INTO GROUPS KNOWING THAT SOMEONE WOULD ARREST THEIR FALLS BUT NO ONE SWOONED BACKWARD ON

INQUIRED I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT MR GATSBY WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU ALONE WITH ME SHE EXCLAIMED IN SURPRISE YES MADAME SHE GOT UP SLOWLY RAISING HER EYEBROWS AT ME IN ASTONISHMENT AND FOLLOWED THE BUTLER TOWARD THE HOUSE I NOTICED THAT SHE WORE HER EVENINGDRESS ALL HER DRESSES LIKE SPORTS CLOTHES THERE WAS A JAUNTINESS ABOUT HER MOVEMENTS AS IF SHE HAD FIRST LEARNED TO WALK UPON GOLF COURSES ON CLEAN CRISP MORNINGS I WAS ALONE AND IT WAS ALMOST TWO FOR SOME TIME CONFUSED AND INTRIGUING SOUNDS HAD ISSUED FROM A LONG MANYWINDOWED ROOM WHICH OVERHUNG THE TERRACE ELUDING JORDANS UNDERGRADUATE WHO WAS NOW ENGAGED IN AN OBSTETRICAL CONVERSATION WITH TWO CHORUS GIRLS AND WHO IMPLORED ME TO JOIN HIM I WENT INSIDE THE LARGE ROOM WAS FULL OF PEOPLE ONE OF THE GIRLS IN YELLOW WAS PLAYING THE PIANO AND BESIDE HER STOOD A TALL REDHAIRED YOUNG LADY FROM A FAMOUS CHORUS ENGAGED IN SONG SHE HAD DRUNK A QUANTITY OF CHAMPAGNE AND DURING THE COURSE OF HER SONG SHE HAD DECIDED INEPTLY THAT EVERYTHING WAS VERY VERY SAD SHE WAS NOT ONLY SINGING SHE WAS WEEPING TOO WHENEVER THERE WAS A PAUSE IN THE SONG SHE FILLED IT WITH GASPING BROKEN SOBS AND THEN TOOK UP THE LYRIC AGAIN IN A QUAVERING SOPRANO THE TEARS COURSED DOWN HER CHEEKS NOT FREELY HOWEVER FOR WHEN THEY CAME INTO CONTACT WITH HER HEAVILY BEADED EYELASHES THEY ASSUMED AN INKY COLOUR AND PURSUED THE REST OF THEIR WAY IN SLOW BLACK RIVULETS A HUMOROUS SUGGESTION WAS MADE THAT SHE SING THE NOTES ON HER FACE WHEREUPON SHE THREW UP HER HANDS SANK INTO A CHAIR AND WENT OFF INTO A DEEP VINOUS SLEEP SHE HAD A FIGHT WITH A MAN

I WAITED FOR MY HAT IN THE HALL THE DOOR OF THE LIBRARY OPENED AND JORDAN BAKER AND GATSBY CAME OUT TOGETHER HE WAS SAYING SOME LAST WORD TO HER BUT THE EAGERNESS IN HIS MANNER TIGHTENED ABRUPTLY INTO FORMALITY AS SEVERAL PEOPLE APPROACHED HIM TO SAY GOODBYE JORDANS PARTY WERE CALLING IMPATIENTLY TO HER FROM THE PORCH BUT SHE LINGERED FOR A MOMENT TO SHAKE HANDS IVE JUST HEARD THE MOST AMAZING

IN A MINUTE TELL THEM ILL BE RIGHT THERE GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT HE SMILED AND SUDDENLY THERE SEEMED TO BE A PLEASANT SIGNIFICANCE IN HAVING BEEN AMONG THE LAST TO GO AS IF HE HAD DESIRED IT ALL THE TIME GOOD NIGHT OLD SPORT GOOD NIGHT BUT AS I WALKED DOWN THE STEPS I SAW THAT THE EVENING WAS NOT QUITE OVER FIFTY FEET FROM THE DOOR A DOZEN HEADLIGHTS ILLUMINATED A BIZARRE AND TUMULTUOUS SCENE IN THE DITCH BESIDE THE ROAD RIGHT SIDE UP BUT VIOLENTLY SHORN OF ONE WHEEL RESTED A NEW COUPé WHICH HAD LEFT GATSBYS DRIVE NOT TWO MINUTES BEFORE THE SHARP JUT OF A WALL ACCOUNTED FOR THE DETACHMENT OF THE WHEEL WHICH WAS NOW GETTING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION FROM HALF A DOZEN CURIOUS CHAUFFEURS HOWEVER AS THEY HAD LEFT THEIR CARS BLOCKING THE ROAD A HARSH DISCORDANT DIN FROM THOSE IN THE REAR HAD BEEN AUDIBLE FOR SOME TIME AND ADDED TO THE ALREADY VIOLENT CONFUSION OF THE SCENE A MAN IN A LONG DUSTER HAD DISMOUNTED FROM THE WRECK AND NOW STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD LOOKING FROM THE CAR TO THE TYRE AND FROM THE TYRE TO THE OBSERVERS IN A PLEASANT PUZZLED WAY SEE HE EXPLAINED IT WENT IN THE DITCH THE FACT WAS INFINITELY ASTONISHING TO HIM AND I RECOGNIZED FIRST THE UNUSUAL QUALITY OF WONDER AND THEN THE MAN IT WAS THE LATE PATRON OF GATSBYS LIBRARY HOWD IT HAPPEN HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I KNOW NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT MECHANICS HE SAID DECISIVELY BUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN DID YOU RUN INTO THE WALL DONT ASK ME SAID OWL EYES WASHING HIS HANDS OF THE WHOLE MATTER I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT DRIVING NEXT TO NOTHING IT HAPPENED AND THATS ALL I KNOW WELL IF YOURE A POOR DRIVER YOU OUGHTNT TO TRY DRIVING AT NIGHT BUT I WASNT EVEN TRYING HE EXPLAINED INDIGNANTLY I WASNT EVEN TRYING AN AWED HUSH FELL UPON THE BYSTANDERS DO YOU WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE YOURE LUCKY IT WAS JUST A WHEEL A BAD DRIVER AND NOT EVEN TRYING YOU DONT UNDERSTAND EXPLAINED THE CRIMINAL I WASNT DRIVING THERES ANOTHER MAN IN THE CAR THE SHOCK THAT FOLLOWED THIS DECLARATION FOUND VOICE IN A SUSTAINED AHHH AS THE DOOR OF THE COUPé SWUNG SLOWLY OPEN THE CROWD IT WAS NOW A CROWD STEPPED BACK INVOLUNTARILY AND WHEN THE DOOR HAD OPENED WIDE THERE WAS A GHOSTLY PAUSE THEN VERY GRADUALLY PART BY PART A PALE DANGLING INDIVIDUAL STEPPED OUT OF THE WRECK PAWING TENTATIVELY AT THE GROUND WITH A LARGE UNCERTAIN DANCING SHOE BLINDED BY THE GLARE OF THE HEADLIGHTS AND CONFUSED BY THE INCESSANT GROANING OF THE HORNS THE APPARITION STOOD SWAYING FOR A MOMENT BEFORE HE PERCEIVED THE MAN IN THE DUSTER WHAS MATTER HE INQUIRED CALMLY DID WE RUN OUTA GAS LOOK HALF A DOZEN FINGERS POINTED AT THE AMPUTATED WHEEL HE STARED AT IT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN LOOKED UPWARD AS THOUGH HE SUSPECTED THAT IT HAD DROPPED FROM THE SKY IT CAME OFF SOMEONE EXPLAINED HE NODDED AT FIRST I DIN NOTICE WED STOPPED A PAUSE THEN TAKING A LONG BREATH AND STRAIGHTENING HIS SHOULDERS HE REMARKED IN A DETERMINED VOICE WONDERFF TELL ME WHERE THERES A GASLINE STATION AT LEAST A DOZEN MEN SOME OF THEM A LITTLE BETTER OFF THAN HE WAS EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT WHEEL AND CAR WERE NO LONGER JOINED BY ANY PHYSICAL BOND BACK OUT HE SUGGESTED AFTER A MOMENT PUT HER IN REVERSE BUT THE WHEELS OFF HE HESITATED NO HARM IN TRYING HE SAID THE CATERWAULING HORNS HAD REACHED A CRESCENDO AND I TURNED AWAY AND CUT ACROSS THE LAWN TOWARD HOME I GLANCED BACK ONCE A WAFER OF A MOON WAS SHINING OVER GATSBYS HOUSE MAKING THE NIGHT FINE AS BEFORE AND SURVIVING THE LAUGHTER AND THE SOUND OF HIS STILL GLOWING GARDEN A SUDDEN EMPTINESS SEEMED TO FLOW NOW FROM THE WINDOWS AND THE GREAT DOORS ENDOWING WITH COMPLETE ISOLATION THE FIGURE OF THE HOST WHO STOOD ON THE PORCH HIS HAND UP IN A FORMAL GESTURE OF FAREWELL READING OVER WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN SO FAR I SEE I HAVE GIVEN THE IMPRESSION THAT THE EVENTS OF THREE NIGHTS SEVERAL WEEKS APART WERE ALL THAT ABSORBED ME ON THE CONTRARY THEY WERE MERELY CASUAL EVENTS IN A CROWDED SUMMER AND UNTIL MUCH LATER THEY ABSORBED ME INFINITELY LESS THAN MY PERSONAL AFFAIRS MOST OF THE TIME I WORKED IN THE EARLY MORNING THE SUN THREW MY SHADOW WESTWARD AS I HURRIED DOWN THE WHITE CHASMS OF LOWER NEW YORK TO THE PROBITY TRUST I KNEW THE OTHER CLERKS AND YOUNG BONDSALESMEN BY THEIR FIRST NAMES AND LUNCHED WITH THEM IN DARK CROWDED RESTAURANTS ON LITTLE PIG SAUSAGES AND MASHED POTATOES AND COFFEE I EVEN HAD A SHORT AFFAIR WITH A GIRL WHO LIVED IN JERSEY CITY AND WORKED IN THE ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT BUT HER BROTHER BEGAN THROWING MEAN LOOKS IN MY DIRECTION SO WHEN SHE WENT ON HER VACATION IN JULY I LET IT BLOW QUIETLY AWAY I TOOK DINNER USUALLY AT THE YALE CLUB FOR SOME REASON IT WAS THE GLOOMIEST EVENT OF MY DAY AND THEN I WENT UPSTAIRS TO THE LIBRARY AND STUDIED INVESTMENTS AND SECURITIES FOR A CONSCIENTIOUS HOUR THERE WERE GENERALLY A FEW RIOTERS AROUND BUT THEY NEVER CAME INTO THE LIBRARY SO IT WAS A GOOD PLACE TO WORK AFTER THAT IF THE NIGHT WAS MELLOW I STROLLED DOWN MADISON AVENUE PAST THE OLD MURRAY HILL HOTEL AND OVER RD STREET TO THE PENNSYLVANIA STATION I BEGAN TO LIKE NEW YORK THE RACY ADVENTUROUS FEEL OF IT AT NIGHT AND THE SATISFACTION THAT THE CONSTANT FLICKER OF MEN AND WOMEN AND MACHINES GIVES TO THE RESTLESS EYE I LIKED TO WALK UP FIFTH AVENUE AND PICK OUT ROMANTIC WOMEN FROM THE CROWD AND IMAGINE THAT IN A FEW MINUTES I WAS GOING TO ENTER INTO THEIR LIVES AND NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW OR DISAPPROVE SOMETIMES IN MY MIND I FOLLOWED THEM TO THEIR APARTMENTS ON THE CORNERS OF HIDDEN STREETS AND THEY TURNED AND SMILED BACK AT ME BEFORE THEY FADED THROUGH A DOOR INTO WARM DARKNESS AT THE ENCHANTED METROPOLITAN TWILIGHT I FELT A HAUNTING LONELINESS SOMETIMES AND FELT IT IN OTHERS POOR YOUNG CLERKS WHO LOITERED IN FRONT OF WINDOWS WAITING UNTIL IT WAS TIME FOR A SOLITARY RESTAURANT DINNER YOUNG CLERKS IN THE DUSK WASTING THE MOST POIGNANT MOMENTS OF NIGHT AND LIFE AGAIN AT EIGHT OCLOCK WHEN THE DARK LANES OF THE FORTIES WERE LINED FIVE DEEP WITH THROBBING TAXICABS BOUND FOR THE THEATRE DISTRICT I FELT A SINKING IN MY HEART FORMS LEANED TOGETHER IN THE TAXIS AS THEY WAITED AND VOICES SANG AND THERE WAS LAUGHTER FROM UNHEARD JOKES AND LIGHTED CIGARETTES MADE UNINTELLIGIBLE CIRCLES INSIDE IMAGINING THAT I TOO WAS HURRYING TOWARDS GAIETY AND SHARING THEIR INTIMATE EXCITEMENT I WISHED THEM WELL FOR A WHILE I LOST SIGHT OF JORDAN BAKER AND THEN IN MIDSUMMER I FOUND HER AGAIN AT FIRST I WAS FLATTERED TO GO PLACES WITH HER BECAUSE SHE WAS A GOLF CHAMPION AND EVERYONE KNEW HER NAME THEN IT WAS SOMETHING MORE I WASNT ACTUALLY IN LOVE BUT I FELT A SORT OF TENDER CURIOSITY THE BORED HAUGHTY FACE THAT SHE TURNED TO THE WORLD CONCEALED SOMETHING MOST AFFECTATIONS CONCEAL SOMETHING EVENTUALLY EVEN THOUGH THEY DONT IN THE BEGINNING AND ONE DAY I FOUND WHAT IT WAS WHEN WE WERE ON A HOUSEPARTY TOGETHER UP IN WARWICK SHE LEFT A BORROWED CAR OUT IN THE RAIN WITH THE TOP DOWN AND THEN LIED ABOUT IT AND SUDDENLY I REMEMBERED THE STORY ABOUT HER THAT HAD ELUDED ME THAT NIGHT AT DAISYS AT HER FIRST BIG GOLF TOURNAMENT THERE WAS A ROW THAT NEARLY REACHED THE NEWSPAPERS A SUGGESTION THAT SHE HAD MOVED HER BALL FROM A BAD LIE IN THE SEMIFINAL ROUND THE THING APPROACHED THE PROPORTIONS OF A SCANDAL THEN DIED AWAY A CADDY RETRACTED HIS STATEMENT AND THE ONLY OTHER WITNESS ADMITTED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN THE INCIDENT AND THE NAME HAD REMAINED TOGETHER IN MY MIND JORDAN BAKER INSTINCTIVELY AVOIDED CLEVER SHREWD MEN AND NOW I SAW THAT THIS WAS BECAUSE SHE FELT SAFER ON A PLANE WHERE ANY DIVERGENCE FROM A CODE WOULD BE THOUGHT IMPOSSIBLE SHE WAS INCURABLY DISHONEST SHE WASNT ABLE TO ENDURE BEING AT A DISADVANTAGE AND GIVEN THIS UNWILLINGNESS I SUPPOSE SHE HAD BEGUN DEALING IN SUBTERFUGES WHEN SHE WAS VERY YOUNG IN ORDER TO KEEP THAT COOL INSOLENT SMILE TURNED TO THE WORLD AND YET SATISFY THE DEMANDS OF HER HARD JAUNTY BODY IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO ME DISHONESTY IN A WOMAN IS A THING YOU NEVER BLAME DEEPLY I WAS CASUALLY SORRY AND THEN I FORGOT IT WAS ON THAT SAME HOUSEPARTY THAT WE HAD A CURIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT DRIVING A CAR IT STARTED BECAUSE SHE PASSED SO CLOSE TO SOME WORKMEN THAT OUR FENDER FLICKED A BUTTON ON ONE MANS COAT YOURE A ROTTEN DRIVER I PROTESTED EITHER YOU OUGHT TO BE MORE CAREFUL OR YOU OUGHTNT TO DRIVE AT ALL I AM CAREFUL NO YOURE NOT WELL OTHER PEOPLE ARE SHE SAID LIGHTLY WHATS THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT THEYLL KEEP OUT OF MY WAY SHE INSISTED IT TAKES TWO TO MAKE AN ACCIDENT SUPPOSE YOU MET SOMEBODY JUST AS CARELESS AS YOURSELF I HOPE I NEVER WILL SHE ANSWERED I HATE CARELESS PEOPLE THATS WHY I LIKE YOU HER GREY SUNSTRAINED EYES STARED STRAIGHT AHEAD BUT SHE HAD DELIBERATELY SHIFTED OUR RELATIONS AND FOR A MOMENT I THOUGHT I LOVED HER BUT I AM SLOWTHINKING AND FULL OF INTERIOR RULES THAT ACT AS BRAKES ON MY DESIRES AND I KNEW THAT FIRST I HAD TO GET MYSELF DEFINITELY OUT OF THAT TANGLE BACK HOME ID BEEN WRITING LETTERS ONCE A WEEK AND SIGNING THEM LOVE NICK AND ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS HOW WHEN THAT CERTAIN GIRL PLAYED TENNIS A FAINT MOUSTACHE OF PERSPIRATION APPEARED ON HER UPPER LIP NEVERTHELESS THERE WAS A VAGUE UNDERSTANDING THAT HAD TO BE TACTFULLY BROKEN OFF BEFORE I WAS FREE EVERYONE SUSPECTS HIMSELF OF AT LEAST ONE OF THE CARDINAL VIRTUES AND THIS IS MINE I AM ONE OF THE FEW HONEST PEOPLE THAT I HAVE EVER KNOWN IV ON SUNDAY MORNING WHILE CHURCH BELLS RANG IN THE VILLAGES ALONGSHORE THE WORLD AND ITS MISTRESS RETURNED TO GATSBYS HOUSE AND TWINKLED

SAYING ‘I WANT TO SEE HER RIGHT NEXT DOOR WHEN I SAID YOU WERE A PARTICULAR FRIEND OF TOMS HE STARTED TO ABANDON THE WHOLE IDEA HE DOESNT KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT TOM THOUGH HE SAYS HES READ A CHICAGO PAPER FOR YEARS JUST ON THE CHANCE OF CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF DAISYS NAME IT WAS DARK NOW AND AS WE DIPPED UNDER A LITTLE BRIDGE I PUT MY ARM AROUND JORDANS GOLDEN SHOULDER AND DREW HER TOWARD ME AND ASKED HER TO DINNER SUDDENLY I WASNT THINKING OF DAISY AND GATSBY ANY MORE BUT OF THIS CLEAN HARD LIMITED PERSON WHO DEALT IN UNIVERSAL SCEPTICISM AND WHO LEANED BACK JAUNTILY JUST WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF MY ARM A PHRASE BEGAN TO BEAT IN MY EARS WITH A SORT OF HEADY EXCITEMENT THERE ARE ONLY THE PURSUED THE PURSUING THE BUSY AND THE TIRED AND DAISY OUGHT TO HAVE SOMETHING IN HER LIFE MURMURED JORDAN TO ME DOES SHE WANT TO SEE GATSBY SHES NOT TO KNOW ABOUT IT GATSBY DOESNT WANT HER TO KNOW YOURE JUST SUPPOSED TO INVITE HER TO TEA WE PASSED A BARRIER OF DARK TREES AND THEN THE FAçADE OF FIFTYNINTH STREET A BLOCK OF DELICATE PALE LIGHT BEAMED DOWN INTO THE PARK UNLIKE GATSBY AND TOM BUCHANAN I HAD NO GIRL WHOSE DISEMBODIED FACE FLOATED ALONG THE DARK CORNICES AND BLINDING SIGNS AND SO I DREW UP THE GIRL BESIDE ME TIGHTENING MY ARMS HER WAN SCORNFUL MOUTH SMILED AND SO I DREW HER UP AGAIN CLOSER THIS TIME TO MY FACE V WHEN I CAME HOME TO WEST EGG THAT NIGHT I WAS AFRAID FOR A MOMENT THAT MY HOUSE WAS ON FIRE TWO OCLOCK AND THE WHOLE CORNER OF THE PENINSULA WAS BLAZING WITH LIGHT WHICH FELL UNREAL ON THE SHRUBBERY AND MADE THIN ELONGATING GLINTS UPON THE ROADSIDE WIRES TURNING A CORNER I SAW THAT IT WAS GATSBYS HOUSE LIT FROM TOWER TO CELLAR AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS ANOTHER PARTY A WILD ROUT THAT HAD RESOLVED ITSELF INTO HIDEANDGOSEEK OR SARDINESINTHEBOX WITH ALL THE HOUSE THROWN OPEN TO THE GAME BUT THERE WASNT A SOUND ONLY WIND IN THE TREES WHICH BLEW THE WIRES AND MADE THE LIGHTS GO OFF AND ON AGAIN AS IF THE HOUSE HAD WINKED INTO THE DARKNESS AS MY TAXI GROANED AWAY I SAW GATSBY WALKING TOWARD ME ACROSS HIS LAWN YOUR PLACE LOOKS LIKE THE WORLDS FAIR I SAID DOES IT HE TURNED HIS EYES TOWARD IT ABSENTLY I HAVE BEEN GLANCING INTO SOME OF THE ROOMS LETS GO TO CONEY ISLAND

YOUR TIME AND YOU MIGHT PICK UP A NICE BIT OF MONEY IT HAPPENS TO BE A RATHER CONFIDENTIAL SORT OF THING I REALIZE NOW THAT UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT CONVERSATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE CRISES OF MY LIFE BUT BECAUSE THE OFFER WAS OBVIOUSLY AND TACTLESSLY FOR A SERVICE TO BE RENDERED I HAD NO CHOICE EXCEPT TO CUT HIM OFF THERE IVE GOT MY HANDS FULL I SAID IM MUCH OBLIGED BUT I COULDNT TAKE ON ANY MORE WORK YOU WOULDNT HAVE TO DO ANY BUSINESS WITH WOLFSHIEM EVIDENTLY HE THOUGHT THAT I WAS SHYING AWAY FROM THE GONNEGTION MENTIONED AT LUNCH BUT I ASSURED HIM HE WAS WRONG HE WAITED A MOMENT LONGER HOPING ID BEGIN A CONVERSATION BUT I WAS TOO ABSORBED TO BE RESPONSIVE SO HE WENT UNWILLINGLY HOME THE EVENING HAD MADE ME LIGHTHEADED AND HAPPY I THINK I WALKED INTO A DEEP SLEEP AS I ENTERED MY FRONT DOOR SO I DONT KNOW WHETHER OR NOT GATSBY WENT TO CONEY ISLAND OR FOR HOW MANY HOURS HE GLANCED INTO ROOMS WHILE HIS HOUSE BLAZED GAUDILY ON I CALLED UP DAISY FROM THE OFFICE NEXT

HIS WATCH AS IF THERE WAS SOME PRESSING DEMAND ON HIS TIME ELSEWHERE I CANT WAIT ALL DAY DONT BE SILLY ITS JUST TWO MINUTES TO FOUR HE SAT DOWN MISERABLY AS IF I HAD PUSHED HIM AND SIMULTANEOUSLY

IT STOPPED DAISYS FACE TIPPED SIDEWAYS BENEATH A THREECORNERED LAVENDER HAT LOOKED OUT AT ME WITH A BRIGHT ECSTATIC SMILE IS THIS ABSOLUTELY WHERE YOU LIVE MY DEAREST ONE THE EXHILARATING RIPPLE OF HER VOICE WAS A WILD TONIC IN THE RAIN I HAD TO FOLLOW THE SOUND OF IT FOR A MOMENT UP AND DOWN WITH MY EAR ALONE BEFORE ANY WORDS CAME THROUGH A DAMP STREAK OF HAIR LAY LIKE A DASH OF BLUE PAINT ACROSS HER CHEEK AND HER HAND WAS WET WITH GLISTENING DROPS AS I TOOK IT TO HELP HER FROM THE CAR ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH ME SHE SAID LOW IN MY EAR OR WHY DID I HAVE TO COME ALONE THATS THE SECRET OF CASTLE RACKRENT TELL YOUR CHAUFFEUR TO GO FAR AWAY AND SPEND AN HOUR COME BACK IN AN HOUR FERDIE THEN IN A GRAVE MURMUR HIS NAME IS FERDIE DOES THE GASOLINE AFFECT HIS NOSE I DONT THINK SO SHE SAID

I WENT OUT AND OPENED IT GATSBY PALE AS DEATH WITH HIS HANDS PLUNGED LIKE WEIGHTS IN HIS COAT POCKETS WAS STANDING IN A PUDDLE OF WATER GLARING TRAGICALLY INTO MY EYES WITH HIS HANDS STILL IN HIS COAT POCKETS HE STALKED BY ME INTO THE HALL TURNED SHARPLY AS IF HE WERE ON A WIRE AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE LIVINGROOM IT WASNT A BIT FUNNY AWARE OF THE LOUD BEATING OF MY OWN HEART I PULLED THE DOOR TO AGAINST THE INCREASING RAIN FOR HALF A MINUTE THERE WASNT A SOUND THEN FROM THE LIVINGROOM I HEARD A SORT OF CHOKING MURMUR AND PART OF A LAUGH FOLLOWED BY DAISYS VOICE ON A CLEAR ARTIFICIAL NOTE I CERTAINLY AM AWFULLY GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN A PAUSE IT ENDURED HORRIBLY I HAD NOTHING TO DO IN THE HALL SO I WENT INTO THE ROOM GATSBY HIS HANDS STILL IN HIS POCKETS WAS RECLINING AGAINST THE MANTELPIECE IN A STRAINED COUNTERFEIT OF PERFECT EASE EVEN OF BOREDOM HIS HEAD LEANED BACK SO FAR THAT IT RESTED AGAINST THE FACE OF A DEFUNCT MANTELPIECE CLOCK AND FROM THIS POSITION HIS DISTRAUGHT EYES STARED DOWN AT DAISY WHO WAS SITTING FRIGHTENED BUT GRACEFUL ON THE EDGE OF A STIFF CHAIR WEVE MET BEFORE MUTTERED GATSBY HIS EYES GLANCED MOMENTARILY AT ME AND HIS LIPS PARTED WITH AN ABORTIVE ATTEMPT AT A LAUGH LUCKILY THE CLOCK TOOK THIS MOMENT TO TILT DANGEROUSLY AT THE PRESSURE OF HIS HEAD WHEREUPON HE TURNED AND CAUGHT IT WITH TREMBLING FINGERS AND SET IT BACK IN PLACE THEN HE SAT DOWN RIGIDLY HIS ELBOW ON THE ARM OF THE SOFA AND HIS CHIN IN HIS HAND IM SORRY ABOUT THE CLOCK HE SAID MY OWN FACE HAD NOW ASSUMED A DEEP TROPICAL BURN I COULDNT MUSTER UP A SINGLE COMMONPLACE OUT OF THE

MATTEROFFACT AS IT COULD EVER BE FIVE YEARS NEXT NOVEMBER THE AUTOMATIC QUALITY OF GATSBYS ANSWER SET US ALL BACK AT LEAST ANOTHER MINUTE I HAD THEM BOTH ON THEIR FEET WITH THE DESPERATE SUGGESTION THAT THEY HELP ME MAKE TEA IN THE KITCHEN WHEN THE DEMONIAC FINN BROUGHT IT IN ON A TRAY AMID THE WELCOME CONFUSION OF CUPS AND CAKES A CERTAIN PHYSICAL DECENCY ESTABLISHED ITSELF GATSBY GOT HIMSELF INTO A SHADOW AND WHILE DAISY AND I TALKED LOOKED CONSCIENTIOUSLY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US WITH TENSE UNHAPPY EYES HOWEVER AS CALMNESS WASNT AN END IN ITSELF I MADE AN EXCUSE AT THE FIRST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND GOT TO MY FEET WHERE ARE YOU GOING DEMANDED GATSBY IN IMMEDIATE ALARM ILL BE BACK IVE GOT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING BEFORE YOU GO HE FOLLOWED ME WILDLY INTO THE KITCHEN CLOSED THE DOOR AND WHISPERED OH GOD IN A MISERABLE WAY WHATS THE MATTER THIS IS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MISTAKE YOURE JUST EMBARRASSED THATS ALL AND

YOURE RUDE DAISYS SITTING IN THERE ALL ALONE HE RAISED HIS HAND TO STOP MY WORDS LOOKED AT ME WITH UNFORGETTABLE REPROACH AND OPENING THE DOOR CAUTIOUSLY WENT BACK INTO THE OTHER ROOM I WALKED OUT THE BACK WAY JUST AS GATSBY HAD WHEN HE HAD MADE HIS NERVOUS CIRCUIT OF THE HOUSE HALF AN HOUR BEFORE AND RAN FOR A HUGE BLACK KNOTTED TREE WHOSE MASSED LEAVES MADE A FABRIC AGAINST THE RAIN ONCE MORE IT WAS POURING AND MY IRREGULAR LAWN WELLSHAVED BY GATSBYS GARDENER ABOUNDED IN SMALL MUDDY SWAMPS AND PREHISTORIC MARSHES THERE WAS NOTHING TO LOOK AT FROM UNDER THE TREE EXCEPT GATSBYS ENORMOUS HOUSE SO I STARED AT IT LIKE KANT AT HIS CHURCH STEEPLE FOR HALF AN HOUR A BREWER HAD BUILT IT EARLY IN THE PERIOD CRAZE A DECADE BEFORE AND THERE WAS A STORY THAT HED AGREED TO PAY FIVE YEARS TAXES ON ALL THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES IF THE OWNERS WOULD HAVE THEIR ROOFS THATCHED WITH STRAW PERHAPS THEIR REFUSAL TOOK THE HEART OUT OF HIS PLAN TO FOUND A FAMILY HE WENT INTO AN IMMEDIATE DECLINE HIS CHILDREN SOLD HIS HOUSE WITH THE BLACK WREATH STILL ON THE DOOR AMERICANS WHILE WILLING EVEN EAGER TO BE SERFS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OBSTINATE ABOUT BEING PEASANTRY AFTER HALF AN HOUR THE SUN SHONE AGAIN AND THE GROCERS AUTOMOBILE ROUNDED GATSBYS DRIVE WITH THE RAW MATERIAL FOR HIS SERVANTS DINNER I FELT SURE HE WOULDNT EAT A SPOONFUL A MAID BEGAN OPENING THE UPPER WINDOWS OF HIS HOUSE APPEARED MOMENTARILY IN EACH AND LEANING FROM THE LARGE CENTRAL BAY SPAT MEDITATIVELY INTO THE GARDEN IT WAS TIME I WENT BACK WHILE THE RAIN CONTINUED IT HAD SEEMED LIKE THE MURMUR OF THEIR VOICES RISING AND SWELLING A LITTLE NOW AND THEN WITH GUSTS OF EMOTION BUT IN THE NEW SILENCE I FELT THAT SILENCE HAD FALLEN WITHIN THE HOUSE TOO I WENT IN AFTER MAKING EVERY POSSIBLE NOISE IN THE KITCHEN SHORT OF PUSHING OVER THE STOVE BUT I DONT BELIEVE THEY HEARD A SOUND THEY WERE SITTING AT EITHER END OF THE COUCH LOOKING AT EACH OTHER AS IF SOME QUESTION HAD BEEN ASKED OR WAS IN THE AIR AND EVERY VESTIGE OF EMBARRASSMENT WAS GONE DAISYS FACE WAS SMEARED WITH TEARS AND WHEN I CAME IN SHE JUMPED UP AND BEGAN WIPING AT IT WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF BEFORE A MIRROR BUT THERE WAS A CHANGE IN GATSBY THAT WAS SIMPLY CONFOUNDING HE LITERALLY GLOWED WITHOUT A WORD OR A GESTURE OF EXULTATION A NEW WELLBEING RADIATED FROM HIM AND FILLED THE LITTLE ROOM OH HELLO OLD SPORT HE SAID AS IF HE HADNT SEEN ME FOR YEARS I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT HE WAS GOING TO SHAKE HANDS ITS STOPPED RAINING HAS IT WHEN HE REALIZED WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT THERE WERE TWINKLEBELLS OF SUNSHINE IN THE ROOM HE SMILED LIKE A WEATHER MAN LIKE AN ECSTATIC PATRON OF RECURRENT LIGHT AND REPEATED THE NEWS TO DAISY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT ITS STOPPED RAINING IM GLAD JAY HER THROAT FULL OF ACHING GRIEVING BEAUTY TOLD ONLY OF HER UNEXPECTED JOY I WANT YOU AND DAISY TO COME OVER TO MY HOUSE HE SAID ID LIKE TO SHOW HER AROUND YOURE SURE YOU WANT ME TO COME ABSOLUTELY OLD SPORT DAISY WENT UPSTAIRS TO WASH HER FACE TOO LATE I THOUGHT WITH HUMILIATION OF MY TOWELS WHILE GATSBY AND I WAITED ON THE LAWN MY HOUSE LOOKS WELL DOESNT IT HE DEMANDED SEE HOW THE WHOLE FRONT OF IT CATCHES THE LIGHT I AGREED THAT IT WAS SPLENDID YES HIS EYES WENT OVER IT EVERY ARCHED DOOR AND SQUARE TOWER IT TOOK ME JUST THREE YEARS TO EARN THE MONEY THAT BOUGHT IT I THOUGHT YOU INHERITED YOUR MONEY I DID OLD SPORT HE SAID AUTOMATICALLY BUT I LOST MOST OF IT IN THE BIG PANIC THE PANIC OF THE WAR I THINK HE HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE WAS SAYING FOR WHEN I ASKED HIM WHAT BUSINESS HE WAS IN HE ANSWERED THATS MY AFFAIR BEFORE HE REALIZED THAT IT WASNT AN APPROPRIATE REPLY OH IVE BEEN IN SEVERAL THINGS HE CORRECTED HIMSELF I WAS IN THE DRUG BUSINESS AND THEN I WAS IN THE OIL BUSINESS BUT IM NOT IN EITHER ONE NOW HE LOOKED AT ME WITH MORE ATTENTION DO YOU MEAN YOUVE BEEN THINKING OVER WHAT I PROPOSED THE OTHER NIGHT BEFORE I COULD ANSWER DAISY CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND TWO ROWS OF BRASS BUTTONS ON HER DRESS GLEAMED IN THE SUNLIGHT THAT HUGE PLACE THERE SHE CRIED POINTING DO YOU LIKE IT I LOVE IT BUT I DONT SEE HOW YOU LIVE THERE ALL ALONE I KEEP IT ALWAYS FULL OF INTERESTING PEOPLE NIGHT AND DAY PEOPLE WHO DO INTERESTING THINGS CELEBRATED PEOPLE INSTEAD OF TAKING THE SHORTCUT ALONG THE SOUND WE WENT DOWN TO THE ROAD AND ENTERED BY THE BIG POSTERN WITH ENCHANTING MURMURS DAISY ADMIRED THIS ASPECT OR THAT OF THE FEUDAL SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY ADMIRED THE GARDENS THE SPARKLING ODOUR OF JONQUILS AND THE FROTHY ODOUR OF HAWTHORN AND PLUM BLOSSOMS AND THE PALE GOLD ODOUR OF KISSMEATTHEGATE IT WAS STRANGE TO REACH THE MARBLE STEPS AND FIND NO STIR OF BRIGHT DRESSES IN AND OUT THE DOOR AND HEAR NO SOUND BUT BIRD VOICES IN THE TREES AND INSIDE AS WE WANDERED THROUGH MARIE ANTOINETTE MUSICROOMS AND RESTORATION SALONS I FELT THAT THERE WERE GUESTS CONCEALED BEHIND EVERY COUCH AND TABLE UNDER ORDERS TO BE BREATHLESSLY SILENT UNTIL WE HAD PASSED THROUGH AS GATSBY CLOSED THE DOOR OF THE MERTON COLLEGE LIBRARY I COULD HAVE SWORN I HEARD THE OWLEYED MAN BREAK INTO GHOSTLY LAUGHTER WE WENT UPSTAIRS THROUGH PERIOD BEDROOMS SWATHED IN ROSE AND LAVENDER SILK AND VIVID WITH NEW FLOWERS THROUGH DRESSINGROOMS AND POOLROOMS AND BATHROOMS WITH SUNKEN BATHS INTRUDING INTO ONE CHAMBER WHERE A DISHEVELLED MAN IN PYJAMAS WAS DOING LIVER EXERCISES ON THE FLOOR IT WAS MR KLIPSPRINGER THE BOARDER I HAD SEEN HIM WANDERING HUNGRILY ABOUT THE BEACH THAT MORNING FINALLY WE CAME TO GATSBYS OWN APARTMENT A BEDROOM AND A BATH AND AN ADAMS STUDY WHERE WE SAT DOWN AND DRANK A GLASS OF SOME CHARTREUSE HE TOOK FROM A CUPBOARD IN THE WALL HE HADNT ONCE CEASED LOOKING AT DAISY AND I THINK HE REVALUED EVERYTHING IN HIS HOUSE ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE OF RESPONSE IT DREW FROM HER WELLLOVED EYES SOMETIMES TOO HE STARED AROUND AT HIS POSSESSIONS IN A DAZED WAY AS THOUGH IN HER ACTUAL AND ASTOUNDING PRESENCE NONE OF IT WAS ANY LONGER REAL ONCE HE NEARLY TOPPLED DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS HIS BEDROOM WAS THE SIMPLEST ROOM OF ALL EXCEPT WHERE THE DRESSER WAS GARNISHED WITH A TOILET SET OF PURE DULL GOLD DAISY TOOK THE BRUSH WITH DELIGHT AND SMOOTHED HER HAIR WHEREUPON GATSBY SAT DOWN AND SHADED HIS EYES AND BEGAN TO LAUGH ITS THE FUNNIEST THING OLD SPORT HE SAID HILARIOUSLY I CANT WHEN I TRY TO HE HAD PASSED VISIBLY THROUGH TWO STATES AND WAS ENTERING UPON A THIRD AFTER HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND HIS UNREASONING JOY HE WAS CONSUMED WITH WONDER AT HER PRESENCE HE HAD BEEN FULL OF THE IDEA SO LONG DREAMED IT RIGHT THROUGH TO THE END WAITED WITH HIS TEETH SET SO TO SPEAK AT AN INCONCEIVABLE PITCH OF INTENSITY NOW IN THE REACTION HE WAS RUNNING DOWN LIKE AN OVERWOUND CLOCK RECOVERING HIMSELF IN A MINUTE HE OPENED FOR US TWO HULKING PATENT CABINETS WHICH HELD HIS MASSED SUITS AND DRESSINGGOWNS AND TIES AND HIS SHIRTS PILED LIKE BRICKS IN STACKS A DOZEN HIGH IVE GOT A MAN IN ENGLAND WHO BUYS ME CLOTHES HE SENDS OVER A SELECTION OF THINGS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH SEASON SPRING AND FALL HE TOOK OUT A PILE OF SHIRTS AND BEGAN THROWING THEM ONE BY ONE BEFORE US SHIRTS OF SHEER LINEN AND THICK SILK AND FINE FLANNEL WHICH LOST THEIR FOLDS AS THEY FELL AND COVERED THE TABLE IN MANYCOLOURED DISARRAY WHILE WE ADMIRED HE BROUGHT MORE AND THE SOFT RICH HEAP MOUNTED HIGHER SHIRTS WITH STRIPES AND SCROLLS AND PLAIDS IN CORAL AND APPLEGREEN AND LAVENDER AND FAINT ORANGE WITH MONOGRAMS OF INDIAN BLUE SUDDENLY WITH A STRAINED SOUND DAISY BENT HER HEAD INTO THE SHIRTS AND BEGAN TO CRY STORMILY THEYRE SUCH BEAUTIFUL SHIRTS SHE SOBBED HER VOICE MUFFLED IN THE THICK FOLDS IT MAKES ME SAD BECAUSE IVE NEVER SEEN SUCH SUCH BEAUTIFUL SHIRTS BEFORE AFTER THE HOUSE WE WERE TO SEE THE GROUNDS AND THE SWIMMING POOL AND THE HYDROPLANE AND THE MIDSUMMER FLOWERS BUT OUTSIDE GATSBYS WINDOW IT BEGAN TO RAIN AGAIN SO WE STOOD IN A ROW LOOKING AT THE CORRUGATED SURFACE OF THE SOUND IF IT WASNT FOR THE MIST WE COULD SEE YOUR HOME ACROSS THE BAY SAID GATSBY YOU ALWAYS HAVE A GREEN LIGHT THAT BURNS ALL NIGHT AT THE END OF YOUR DOCK DAISY PUT HER ARM THROUGH HIS ABRUPTLY BUT HE SEEMED ABSORBED IN WHAT HE HAD JUST SAID POSSIBLY IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE COLOSSAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT LIGHT HAD NOW VANISHED FOREVER COMPARED TO THE GREAT DISTANCE THAT HAD SEPARATED HIM FROM DAISY IT HAD SEEMED VERY NEAR TO HER ALMOST TOUCHING HER IT HAD SEEMED AS CLOSE AS A STAR TO THE MOON NOW IT WAS AGAIN A GREEN LIGHT ON A DOCK HIS COUNT OF ENCHANTED OBJECTS HAD DIMINISHED BY ONE I BEGAN TO WALK ABOUT THE ROOM EXAMINING VARIOUS INDEFINITE OBJECTS IN THE HALF DARKNESS A LARGE PHOTOGRAPH OF AN ELDERLY MAN IN YACHTING COSTUME ATTRACTED ME HUNG ON THE WALL OVER HIS DESK WHOS THIS THAT THATS MR DAN CODY OLD SPORT THE NAME SOUNDED FAINTLY FAMILIAR HES DEAD NOW HE USED TO BE MY BEST FRIEND YEARS AGO THERE WAS A SMALL

RANG OFF COME HERE QUICK CRIED DAISY AT THE WINDOW THE RAIN WAS STILL FALLING BUT THE DARKNESS HAD PARTED IN THE WEST AND THERE WAS A PINK AND GOLDEN BILLOW OF FOAMY CLOUDS ABOVE THE SEA LOOK AT THAT SHE WHISPERED AND THEN AFTER A MOMENT ID LIKE TO JUST GET ONE OF THOSE PINK CLOUDS AND PUT YOU IN IT AND PUSH YOU AROUND I TRIED TO GO THEN BUT THEY WOULDNT HEAR OF IT PERHAPS MY PRESENCE MADE THEM FEEL MORE SATISFACTORILY ALONE I KNOW WHAT WELL DO SAID GATSBY WELL HAVE KLIPSPRINGER PLAY THE PIANO HE WENT OUT OF THE ROOM CALLING EWING AND RETURNED IN A FEW MINUTES ACCOMPANIED BY AN EMBARRASSED SLIGHTLY WORN YOUNG MAN WITH SHELLRIMMED GLASSES AND SCANTY BLOND HAIR HE WAS NOW DECENTLY CLOTHED IN A SPORT SHIRT OPEN AT THE NECK SNEAKERS AND DUCK TROUSERS OF A NEBULOUS HUE DID WE INTERRUPT YOUR EXERCISE INQUIRED DAISY POLITELY I WAS ASLEEP CRIED MR KLIPSPRINGER IN A SPASM OF EMBARRASSMENT THAT IS ID BEEN ASLEEP THEN I GOT UP KLIPSPRINGER PLAYS THE PIANO SAID GATSBY CUTTING HIM OFF DONT YOU EWING OLD SPORT I DONT PLAY WELL I DONT HARDLY PLAY AT ALL IM ALL OUT OF PRAC WELL GO DOWNSTAIRS INTERRUPTED GATSBY HE FLIPPED A SWITCH THE GREY WINDOWS DISAPPEARED AS THE HOUSE GLOWED FULL OF LIGHT IN THE MUSICROOM GATSBY TURNED ON A SOLITARY LAMP BESIDE THE PIANO HE LIT DAISYS CIGARETTE FROM A TREMBLING MATCH AND SAT DOWN WITH HER ON A COUCH FAR ACROSS THE ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NO LIGHT SAVE WHAT THE GLEAMING FLOOR BOUNCED IN FROM THE HALL WHEN KLIPSPRINGER HAD PLAYED THE LOVE NEST HE TURNED AROUND ON THE BENCH AND SEARCHED UNHAPPILY FOR GATSBY IN THE GLOOM IM ALL OUT OF PRACTICE YOU SEE I TOLD YOU I COULDNT PLAY IM ALL OUT OF PRAC DONT TALK SO MUCH OLD SPORT COMMANDED GATSBY PLAY IN THE MORNING IN THE EVENING AINT WE GOT FUN OUTSIDE THE WIND WAS LOUD AND THERE WAS A FAINT FLOW OF THUNDER ALONG THE SOUND ALL THE LIGHTS WERE GOING ON IN WEST EGG NOW THE ELECTRIC TRAINS MENCARRYING WERE PLUNGING HOME THROUGH THE RAIN FROM NEW YORK IT WAS THE HOUR OF A PROFOUND HUMAN CHANGE AND EXCITEMENT WAS GENERATING ON THE AIR ONE THINGS SURE AND NOTHINGS SURER THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET CHILDREN IN THE MEANTIME IN BETWEEN TIME AS I WENT OVER TO SAY GOODBYE I SAW THAT THE EXPRESSION OF BEWILDERMENT HAD COME BACK INTO GATSBYS FACE AS THOUGH A FAINT DOUBT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM AS TO THE QUALITY OF HIS PRESENT HAPPINESS ALMOST FIVE YEARS THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MOMENTS EVEN THAT AFTERNOON WHEN DAISY TUMBLED SHORT OF HIS DREAMS NOT THROUGH HER OWN FAULT BUT BECAUSE OF THE COLOSSAL VITALITY OF HIS ILLUSION IT HAD GONE BEYOND HER BEYOND EVERYTHING HE HAD THROWN HIMSELF INTO IT WITH A CREATIVE PASSION ADDING TO IT ALL THE TIME DECKING IT OUT WITH EVERY BRIGHT FEATHER THAT DRIFTED HIS WAY NO AMOUNT OF FIRE OR FRESHNESS CAN CHALLENGE WHAT A MAN CAN STORE UP IN HIS GHOSTLY HEART AS I WATCHED HIM HE ADJUSTED HIMSELF A LITTLE VISIBLY HIS HAND TOOK HOLD OF HERS AND AS SHE SAID SOMETHING LOW IN HIS EAR HE TURNED TOWARD HER WITH A RUSH OF EMOTION I THINK THAT VOICE HELD HIM MOST WITH ITS FLUCTUATING FEVERISH WARMTH BECAUSE IT COULDNT BE OVERDREAMED THAT VOICE WAS A DEATHLESS SONG THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ME BUT DAISY GLANCED UP AND HELD OUT HER HAND GATSBY DIDNT KNOW ME NOW AT ALL I LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THEM AND THEY LOOKED BACK AT ME REMOTELY POSSESSED BY INTENSE LIFE THEN I WENT OUT OF THE ROOM AND DOWN THE MARBLE STEPS INTO THE RAIN LEAVING THEM THERE TOGETHER VI ABOUT THIS TIME AN AMBITIOUS YOUNG REPORTER FROM NEW YORK ARRIVED ONE MORNING AT GATSBYS DOOR AND ASKED HIM IF HE HAD ANYTHING TO SAY ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT WHAT INQUIRED GATSBY POLITELY WHY ANY STATEMENT TO GIVE OUT IT TRANSPIRED AFTER A CONFUSED FIVE MINUTES THAT THE MAN HAD HEARD GATSBYS NAME AROUND HIS OFFICE IN A CONNECTION WHICH HE EITHER WOULDNT REVEAL OR DIDNT FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS WAS HIS DAY OFF AND WITH LAUDABLE INITIATIVE HE HAD HURRIED OUT TO SEE IT WAS A RANDOM SHOT AND YET THE REPORTERS INSTINCT WAS RIGHT GATSBYS NOTORIETY SPREAD ABOUT BY THE HUNDREDS WHO HAD ACCEPTED HIS HOSPITALITY AND SO BECOME AUTHORITIES UPON HIS PAST HAD INCREASED ALL SUMMER UNTIL HE FELL JUST SHORT OF BEING NEWS CONTEMPORARY LEGENDS SUCH AS THE UNDERGROUND PIPELINE TO CANADA ATTACHED THEMSELVES TO HIM AND THERE WAS ONE PERSISTENT STORY THAT HE DIDNT LIVE IN A HOUSE AT ALL BUT IN A BOAT THAT LOOKED LIKE A HOUSE AND WAS MOVED SECRETLY UP AND DOWN THE LONG ISLAND SHORE JUST WHY THESE INVENTIONS WERE A SOURCE OF SATISFACTION TO JAMES GATZ OF NORTH DAKOTA ISNT EASY TO SAY JAMES GATZ THAT WAS REALLY OR AT LEAST LEGALLY HIS NAME HE HAD CHANGED IT AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN AND AT THE SPECIFIC MOMENT THAT WITNESSED THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER WHEN HE SAW DAN CODYS YACHT DROP ANCHOR OVER THE MOST INSIDIOUS FLAT ON LAKE SUPERIOR IT WAS JAMES GATZ WHO HAD BEEN LOAFING ALONG THE BEACH THAT AFTERNOON IN A TORN GREEN JERSEY AND A PAIR OF CANVAS PANTS BUT IT WAS ALREADY JAY GATSBY WHO BORROWED A ROWBOAT PULLED OUT TO THE TUOLOMEE AND INFORMED CODY THAT A WIND MIGHT CATCH HIM AND BREAK HIM UP IN HALF AN HOUR I SUPPOSE HED HAD THE NAME READY FOR A LONG TIME EVEN THEN HIS PARENTS WERE SHIFTLESS AND UNSUCCESSFUL FARM PEOPLE HIS IMAGINATION HAD NEVER REALLY ACCEPTED THEM AS HIS PARENTS AT ALL THE TRUTH WAS THAT JAY GATSBY OF WEST EGG LONG ISLAND SPRANG FROM HIS PLATONIC CONCEPTION OF HIMSELF HE WAS A SON OF GOD A PHRASE WHICH IF IT MEANS ANYTHING MEANS JUST THAT AND HE MUST BE ABOUT HIS FATHERS BUSINESS THE SERVICE OF A VAST VULGAR AND MERETRICIOUS BEAUTY SO HE INVENTED JUST THE SORT OF JAY GATSBY THAT A SEVENTEENYEAROLD BOY WOULD BE LIKELY TO INVENT AND TO THIS CONCEPTION HE WAS FAITHFUL TO THE END FOR OVER A YEAR HE HAD BEEN BEATING HIS WAY ALONG THE SOUTH SHORE OF LAKE SUPERIOR AS A CLAMDIGGER AND A SALMONFISHER OR IN ANY OTHER CAPACITY THAT BROUGHT HIM FOOD AND BED HIS BROWN HARDENING BODY LIVED NATURALLY THROUGH THE HALFFIERCE HALFLAZY WORK OF THE BRACING DAYS HE KNEW WOMEN EARLY AND SINCE THEY SPOILED HIM HE BECAME CONTEMPTUOUS OF THEM OF YOUNG VIRGINS BECAUSE THEY WERE IGNORANT OF THE OTHERS BECAUSE THEY WERE HYSTERICAL ABOUT THINGS WHICH IN HIS OVERWHELMING SELFABSORPTION HE TOOK FOR GRANTED BUT HIS HEART WAS IN A CONSTANT TURBULENT RIOT THE MOST GROTESQUE AND FANTASTIC CONCEITS HAUNTED HIM IN HIS BED AT NIGHT A UNIVERSE OF INEFFABLE GAUDINESS SPUN ITSELF OUT IN HIS BRAIN WHILE THE CLOCK TICKED ON THE WASHSTAND AND THE MOON SOAKED WITH WET LIGHT HIS TANGLED CLOTHES UPON THE FLOOR EACH NIGHT HE ADDED TO THE PATTERN OF HIS FANCIES UNTIL DROWSINESS CLOSED DOWN UPON SOME VIVID SCENE WITH AN OBLIVIOUS EMBRACE FOR A WHILE THESE REVERIES PROVIDED AN OUTLET FOR HIS IMAGINATION THEY WERE A SATISFACTORY HINT OF THE UNREALITY OF REALITY A PROMISE THAT THE ROCK OF THE WORLD WAS FOUNDED SECURELY ON A FAIRYS WING AN INSTINCT TOWARD HIS FUTURE GLORY HAD LED HIM SOME MONTHS BEFORE TO THE SMALL LUTHERAN COLLEGE OF ST OLAFS IN SOUTHERN MINNESOTA HE STAYED THERE TWO WEEKS DISMAYED AT ITS FEROCIOUS INDIFFERENCE TO THE DRUMS OF HIS DESTINY TO DESTINY ITSELF AND DESPISING THE JANITORS WORK WITH WHICH HE WAS TO PAY HIS WAY THROUGH THEN HE DRIFTED BACK TO LAKE SUPERIOR AND HE WAS STILL SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING TO DO ON THE DAY THAT DAN CODYS YACHT DROPPED ANCHOR IN THE SHALLOWS ALONGSHORE CODY WAS FIFTY YEARS OLD THEN A PRODUCT OF THE NEVADA SILVER FIELDS OF THE YUKON OF EVERY RUSH FOR METAL SINCE SEVENTYFIVE THE TRANSACTIONS IN MONTANA COPPER THAT MADE HIM MANY TIMES A MILLIONAIRE FOUND HIM PHYSICALLY ROBUST BUT ON THE VERGE OF SOFTMINDEDNESS AND SUSPECTING THIS AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WOMEN TRIED TO SEPARATE HIM FROM HIS MONEY THE NONE TOO SAVOURY RAMIFICATIONS BY WHICH ELLA KAYE THE NEWSPAPER WOMAN PLAYED MADAME DE MAINTENON TO HIS WEAKNESS AND SENT HIM TO SEA IN A YACHT WERE COMMON PROPERTY OF THE TURGID JOURNALISM IN HE HAD BEEN COASTING ALONG ALL TOO HOSPITABLE SHORES FOR FIVE YEARS WHEN HE TURNED UP AS JAMES GATZS DESTINY IN LITTLE GIRL BAY TO YOUNG GATZ RESTING ON HIS OARS AND LOOKING UP AT THE RAILED DECK THAT YACHT REPRESENTED ALL THE BEAUTY AND GLAMOUR IN THE WORLD I SUPPOSE HE SMILED AT CODY HE HAD PROBABLY DISCOVERED THAT PEOPLE LIKED HIM WHEN HE SMILED AT ANY RATE CODY ASKED HIM A FEW QUESTIONS ONE OF THEM ELICITED THE BRAND NEW NAME AND FOUND THAT HE WAS QUICK AND EXTRAVAGANTLY AMBITIOUS A FEW DAYS LATER HE TOOK HIM TO DULUTH AND BOUGHT HIM A BLUE COAT SIX PAIRS OF WHITE DUCK TROUSERS AND A YACHTING CAP AND WHEN THE TUOLOMEE LEFT FOR THE WEST INDIES AND THE BARBARY COAST GATSBY LEFT TOO HE WAS EMPLOYED IN A VAGUE PERSONAL CAPACITY WHILE HE REMAINED WITH CODY HE WAS IN TURN STEWARD MATE SKIPPER SECRETARY AND EVEN JAILOR FOR DAN CODY SOBER KNEW WHAT LAVISH DOINGS DAN CODY DRUNK MIGHT SOON BE ABOUT AND HE PROVIDED FOR SUCH CONTINGENCIES BY REPOSING MORE AND MORE TRUST IN GATSBY THE ARRANGEMENT LASTED FIVE YEARS DURING WHICH THE BOAT WENT THREE TIMES AROUND THE CONTINENT IT MIGHT HAVE LASTED INDEFINITELY EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT ELLA KAYE CAME ON BOARD ONE NIGHT IN BOSTON AND A WEEK LATER DAN CODY INHOSPITABLY DIED I REMEMBER THE PORTRAIT OF HIM UP IN GATSBYS BEDROOM A GREY FLORID MAN WITH A HARD EMPTY FACE THE PIONEER DEBAUCHEE WHO DURING ONE PHASE OF AMERICAN LIFE BROUGHT BACK TO THE EASTERN SEABOARD THE SAVAGE VIOLENCE OF THE FRONTIER BROTHEL AND SALOON IT WAS INDIRECTLY DUE TO CODY THAT GATSBY DRANK SO LITTLE SOMETIMES IN THE COURSE OF GAY PARTIES WOMEN USED TO RUB CHAMPAGNE INTO HIS HAIR FOR HIMSELF HE FORMED THE HABIT OF LETTING LIQUOR ALONE AND IT WAS FROM CODY THAT HE INHERITED MONEY A LEGACY OF TWENTYFIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS HE DIDNT GET IT HE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE LEGAL DEVICE THAT WAS USED AGAINST HIM BUT WHAT REMAINED OF THE MILLIONS WENT INTACT TO ELLA KAYE HE WAS LEFT WITH HIS SINGULARLY APPROPRIATE EDUCATION THE VAGUE CONTOUR OF JAY GATSBY HAD FILLED OUT TO THE SUBSTANTIALITY OF A MAN HE TOLD ME ALL THIS VERY MUCH LATER BUT IVE PUT IT DOWN HERE WITH THE IDEA OF EXPLODING THOSE FIRST WILD RUMOURS ABOUT HIS ANTECEDENTS WHICH WERENT EVEN FAINTLY TRUE MOREOVER HE TOLD IT TO ME AT A TIME OF CONFUSION WHEN I HAD REACHED THE POINT OF BELIEVING EVERYTHING AND NOTHING ABOUT HIM SO I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SHORT HALT WHILE GATSBY SO TO SPEAK CAUGHT HIS BREATH TO CLEAR THIS SET OF MISCONCEPTIONS AWAY IT WAS A HALT TOO IN MY ASSOCIATION WITH HIS AFFAIRS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS I DIDNT SEE HIM OR HEAR HIS VOICE ON THE PHONE MOSTLY I WAS IN NEW YORK TROTTING AROUND WITH JORDAN AND TRYING TO INGRATIATE MYSELF WITH HER SENILE AUNT BUT FINALLY I WENT OVER TO HIS HOUSE ONE SUNDAY AFTERNOON I HADNT BEEN THERE TWO MINUTES WHEN SOMEBODY BROUGHT TOM BUCHANAN IN FOR A

RUNNING AROUND ALONE FOR ON THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY NIGHT HE CAME WITH HER TO GATSBYS PARTY PERHAPS HIS PRESENCE GAVE THE EVENING ITS PECULIAR QUALITY OF OPPRESSIVENESS IT STANDS OUT IN MY MEMORY FROM GATSBYS OTHER PARTIES THAT SUMMER THERE WERE THE SAME PEOPLE OR AT LEAST THE SAME SORT OF PEOPLE THE SAME PROFUSION OF CHAMPAGNE THE SAME MANYCOLOURED MANYKEYED COMMOTION BUT I FELT AN UNPLEASANTNESS IN THE AIR A PERVADING HARSHNESS THAT HADNT BEEN THERE BEFORE OR PERHAPS I HAD MERELY GROWN USED TO IT GROWN TO ACCEPT WEST EGG AS A WORLD COMPLETE IN ITSELF WITH ITS OWN STANDARDS AND ITS OWN GREAT FIGURES SECOND TO NOTHING BECAUSE IT HAD NO CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING SO AND NOW I WAS LOOKING AT IT AGAIN THROUGH DAISYS EYES IT IS INVARIABLY SADDENING TO LOOK THROUGH NEW EYES AT THINGS UPON WHICH YOU

SIMPLICITY SHE FAILED TO UNDERSTAND I SAT ON THE FRONT STEPS WITH THEM WHILE THEY WAITED FOR THEIR CAR IT WAS DARK HERE IN FRONT ONLY THE BRIGHT DOOR SENT TEN SQUARE FEET OF LIGHT VOLLEYING OUT INTO

DAISYS FUR COLLAR AT LEAST THEY ARE MORE INTERESTING THAN THE PEOPLE WE KNOW SHE SAID WITH AN EFFORT YOU DIDNT LOOK SO INTERESTED WELL I WAS TOM LAUGHED AND TURNED TO ME DID YOU NOTICE DAISYS FACE WHEN THAT GIRL ASKED HER TO PUT HER UNDER A COLD SHOWER DAISY BEGAN TO SING WITH THE MUSIC IN A HUSKY RHYTHMIC WHISPER BRINGING OUT A MEANING IN EACH WORD THAT IT HAD NEVER HAD BEFORE AND WOULD NEVER HAVE AGAIN WHEN THE MELODY ROSE HER VOICE BROKE UP SWEETLY FOLLOWING IT IN A WAY CONTRALTO VOICES HAVE AND EACH CHANGE TIPPED OUT A LITTLE OF HER WARM HUMAN MAGIC UPON THE AIR LOTS OF PEOPLE COME WHO HAVENT BEEN INVITED SHE SAID SUDDENLY THAT GIRL HADNT BEEN INVITED THEY SIMPLY FORCE THEIR WAY IN AND HES TOO POLITE TO OBJECT ID LIKE TO KNOW WHO HE IS AND WHAT HE DOES INSISTED TOM AND I THINK ILL MAKE A POINT OF FINDING OUT I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW SHE ANSWERED HE OWNED SOME DRUGSTORES A LOT OF DRUGSTORES HE BUILT THEM UP HIMSELF THE DILATORY LIMOUSINE CAME ROLLING UP THE DRIVE GOOD NIGHT NICK SAID DAISY HER GLANCE LEFT ME AND SOUGHT THE LIGHTED TOP OF THE STEPS WHERE THREE OCLOCK IN THE MORNING A NEAT SAD LITTLE WALTZ OF THAT YEAR WAS DRIFTING OUT THE OPEN DOOR AFTER ALL IN THE VERY CASUALNESS OF GATSBYS PARTY THERE WERE ROMANTIC POSSIBILITIES TOTALLY ABSENT FROM HER WORLD WHAT WAS IT UP THERE IN THE SONG THAT SEEMED TO BE CALLING HER BACK INSIDE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NOW IN THE DIM INCALCULABLE HOURS PERHAPS SOME UNBELIEVABLE GUEST WOULD ARRIVE A PERSON INFINITELY RARE AND TO BE MARVELLED AT SOME AUTHENTICALLY RADIANT YOUNG GIRL WHO WITH ONE FRESH GLANCE AT GATSBY ONE MOMENT OF MAGICAL ENCOUNTER WOULD BLOT OUT THOSE FIVE YEARS OF UNWAVERING DEVOTION I STAYED LATE THAT NIGHT GATSBY ASKED ME TO WAIT UNTIL HE WAS FREE AND I LINGERED IN THE GARDEN UNTIL THE INEVITABLE SWIMMING PARTY HAD RUN UP CHILLED AND EXALTED FROM THE BLACK BEACH UNTIL THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED IN THE GUESTROOMS OVERHEAD WHEN HE CAME DOWN THE STEPS AT LAST THE TANNED SKIN WAS DRAWN UNUSUALLY TIGHT ON HIS FACE AND HIS EYES WERE BRIGHT AND TIRED SHE DIDNT LIKE IT HE SAID IMMEDIATELY OF COURSE SHE DID SHE DIDNT LIKE IT HE INSISTED SHE DIDNT HAVE A GOOD TIME HE WAS SILENT AND I GUESSED AT HIS UNUTTERABLE DEPRESSION I FEEL FAR AWAY FROM HER HE SAID ITS HARD TO MAKE HER UNDERSTAND YOU MEAN ABOUT THE DANCE THE DANCE HE DISMISSED ALL THE DANCES HE HAD GIVEN WITH A SNAP OF HIS FINGERS OLD SPORT THE DANCE IS UNIMPORTANT HE WANTED NOTHING LESS OF DAISY THAN THAT SHE SHOULD GO TO TOM AND SAY I NEVER LOVED YOU AFTER SHE HAD OBLITERATED FOUR YEARS WITH THAT SENTENCE THEY COULD DECIDE UPON THE MORE PRACTICAL MEASURES TO BE TAKEN ONE OF THEM WAS THAT AFTER SHE WAS FREE THEY WERE TO GO BACK TO LOUISVILLE AND BE MARRIED FROM HER HOUSE JUST AS IF IT WERE FIVE YEARS AGO AND SHE DOESNT UNDERSTAND HE SAID SHE USED TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WED SIT FOR HOURS HE BROKE OFF AND BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN A DESOLATE PATH OF FRUIT RINDS AND DISCARDED FAVOURS AND CRUSHED FLOWERS I WOULDNT ASK TOO MUCH OF HER I VENTURED YOU CANT REPEAT THE PAST CANT REPEAT THE PAST HE CRIED INCREDULOUSLY WHY OF COURSE YOU CAN HE LOOKED AROUND HIM WILDLY AS IF THE PAST WERE LURKING HERE IN THE SHADOW OF HIS HOUSE JUST OUT OF REACH OF HIS HAND IM GOING TO FIX EVERYTHING JUST THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE HE SAID NODDING DETERMINEDLY SHELL SEE HE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE PAST AND I GATHERED THAT HE WANTED TO RECOVER SOMETHING SOME IDEA OF HIMSELF PERHAPS THAT HAD GONE INTO LOVING DAISY HIS LIFE HAD BEEN CONFUSED AND DISORDERED SINCE THEN BUT IF HE COULD ONCE RETURN TO A CERTAIN STARTING PLACE AND GO OVER IT ALL SLOWLY HE COULD FIND OUT WHAT THAT THING WAS ONE AUTUMN NIGHT FIVE YEARS BEFORE THEY HAD BEEN WALKING DOWN THE STREET WHEN THE LEAVES WERE FALLING AND THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THERE WERE NO TREES AND THE SIDEWALK WAS WHITE WITH MOONLIGHT THEY STOPPED HERE AND TURNED TOWARD EACH OTHER NOW IT WAS A COOL NIGHT WITH THAT MYSTERIOUS EXCITEMENT IN IT WHICH COMES AT THE TWO CHANGES OF THE YEAR THE QUIET LIGHTS IN THE HOUSES WERE HUMMING OUT INTO THE DARKNESS AND THERE WAS A STIR AND BUSTLE AMONG THE STARS OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE GATSBY SAW THAT THE BLOCKS OF THE SIDEWALKS REALLY FORMED A LADDER AND MOUNTED TO A SECRET PLACE ABOVE THE TREES HE COULD CLIMB TO IT IF HE CLIMBED ALONE AND ONCE THERE HE COULD SUCK ON THE PAP OF LIFE GULP DOWN THE INCOMPARABLE MILK OF WONDER HIS HEART BEAT FASTER AS DAISYS WHITE FACE CAME UP TO HIS OWN HE KNEW THAT WHEN HE KISSED THIS GIRL AND FOREVER WED HIS UNUTTERABLE VISIONS TO HER PERISHABLE BREATH HIS MIND WOULD NEVER ROMP AGAIN LIKE THE MIND OF GOD SO HE WAITED LISTENING FOR A MOMENT LONGER TO THE TUNINGFORK THAT HAD BEEN STRUCK UPON A STAR THEN HE KISSED HER AT HIS LIPS TOUCH SHE BLOSSOMED FOR HIM LIKE A FLOWER AND THE INCARNATION WAS COMPLETE THROUGH ALL HE SAID EVEN THROUGH HIS APPALLING SENTIMENTALITY I WAS REMINDED OF SOMETHING AN ELUSIVE RHYTHM A FRAGMENT OF LOST WORDS THAT I HAD HEARD SOMEWHERE A LONG TIME AGO FOR A MOMENT A PHRASE TRIED TO TAKE SHAPE IN MY MOUTH AND MY LIPS PARTED LIKE A DUMB MANS AS THOUGH THERE WAS MORE STRUGGLING UPON THEM THAN A WISP OF STARTLED AIR BUT THEY MADE NO SOUND AND WHAT I HAD ALMOST REMEMBERED WAS UNCOMMUNICABLE FOREVER VII IT WAS WHEN CURIOSITY ABOUT GATSBY WAS AT ITS HIGHEST THAT THE LIGHTS IN HIS HOUSE FAILED TO GO ON ONE SATURDAY NIGHT AND AS OBSCURELY AS IT HAD BEGUN HIS CAREER AS TRIMALCHIO WAS OVER ONLY GRADUALLY DID I BECOME AWARE THAT THE AUTOMOBILES WHICH TURNED EXPECTANTLY INTO HIS DRIVE STAYED FOR JUST A MINUTE AND THEN DROVE SULKILY AWAY WONDERING IF HE WERE SICK I WENT OVER TO FIND OUT AN UNFAMILIAR BUTLER WITH A VILLAINOUS FACE SQUINTED AT ME SUSPICIOUSLY FROM THE DOOR IS MR GATSBY SICK NOPE AFTER A PAUSE HE ADDED SIR IN A DILATORY GRUDGING WAY I HADNT

BOTTLE OF WHISKY IN THE TOWEL WANT ANY OF THIS STUFF JORDAN NICK I DIDNT ANSWER NICK HE ASKED AGAIN WHAT WANT ANY NO I JUST REMEMBERED THAT TODAYS MY BIRTHDAY I WAS THIRTY BEFORE ME STRETCHED THE PORTENTOUS MENACING ROAD OF A NEW DECADE IT WAS SEVEN OCLOCK WHEN WE GOT INTO THE COUPé WITH HIM AND STARTED FOR LONG ISLAND TOM TALKED INCESSANTLY EXULTING AND LAUGHING BUT HIS VOICE WAS AS REMOTE FROM JORDAN AND ME AS THE FOREIGN CLAMOUR ON THE SIDEWALK OR THE TUMULT OF THE ELEVATED OVERHEAD HUMAN SYMPATHY HAS ITS LIMITS AND WE WERE CONTENT TO LET ALL THEIR TRAGIC ARGUMENTS FADE WITH THE CITY LIGHTS BEHIND THIRTY THE PROMISE OF A DECADE OF LONELINESS A THINNING LIST OF SINGLE MEN TO KNOW A THINNING BRIEFCASE OF ENTHUSIASM THINNING HAIR BUT THERE WAS JORDAN BESIDE ME WHO UNLIKE DAISY WAS TOO WISE EVER TO CARRY WELLFORGOTTEN DREAMS FROM AGE TO AGE AS WE PASSED OVER THE DARK BRIDGE HER WAN FACE FELL LAZILY AGAINST MY COATS SHOULDER AND THE FORMIDABLE STROKE OF THIRTY DIED AWAY WITH THE REASSURING PRESSURE OF HER HAND SO WE DROVE ON TOWARD DEATH THROUGH THE COOLING TWILIGHT THE YOUNG GREEK MICHAELIS WHO RAN THE COFFEE JOINT BESIDE THE ASHHEAPS WAS THE PRINCIPAL WITNESS AT THE INQUEST HE HAD SLEPT THROUGH THE HEAT UNTIL AFTER FIVE WHEN HE STROLLED OVER TO THE GARAGE AND FOUND GEORGE WILSON SICK IN HIS OFFICE REALLY SICK PALE AS HIS OWN PALE HAIR AND SHAKING ALL OVER MICHAELIS ADVISED HIM TO GO TO BED BUT WILSON REFUSED SAYING THAT HED MISS A LOT OF BUSINESS IF HE DID WHILE HIS NEIGHBOUR WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM A VIOLENT RACKET BROKE OUT OVERHEAD IVE GOT MY WIFE LOCKED IN UP THERE EXPLAINED WILSON CALMLY SHES GOING TO STAY THERE TILL THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW AND THEN WERE GOING TO MOVE AWAY MICHAELIS WAS ASTONISHED THEY HAD BEEN NEIGHBOURS FOR FOUR YEARS AND WILSON HAD NEVER SEEMED FAINTLY CAPABLE OF SUCH A STATEMENT GENERALLY HE WAS ONE OF THESE WORNOUT MEN WHEN HE WASNT WORKING HE SAT ON A CHAIR IN THE DOORWAY AND STARED AT THE PEOPLE AND THE CARS THAT PASSED ALONG THE ROAD WHEN ANYONE SPOKE TO HIM HE INVARIABLY LAUGHED IN AN AGREEABLE COLOURLESS WAY HE WAS HIS WIFES MAN AND NOT HIS OWN SO NATURALLY MICHAELIS TRIED TO FIND OUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT WILSON WOULDNT SAY A WORD INSTEAD HE BEGAN TO THROW CURIOUS SUSPICIOUS GLANCES AT HIS VISITOR AND ASK HIM WHAT HED BEEN DOING AT CERTAIN TIMES ON CERTAIN DAYS JUST AS THE LATTER WAS GETTING UNEASY SOME WORKMEN CAME PAST THE DOOR BOUND FOR HIS RESTAURANT AND MICHAELIS TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET AWAY INTENDING TO COME BACK LATER BUT HE DIDNT HE SUPPOSED HE FORGOT TO THATS ALL WHEN HE CAME OUTSIDE AGAIN A LITTLE AFTER SEVEN HE WAS REMINDED OF THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE HE HEARD MRS WILSONS VOICE LOUD AND SCOLDING DOWNSTAIRS IN THE GARAGE BEAT ME HE HEARD HER CRY THROW ME DOWN AND BEAT ME YOU DIRTY LITTLE COWARD A MOMENT LATER SHE RUSHED OUT INTO THE DUSK WAVING HER HANDS AND SHOUTING BEFORE HE COULD MOVE FROM HIS DOOR THE BUSINESS WAS OVER THE DEATH CAR AS THE NEWSPAPERS CALLED IT DIDNT STOP IT CAME OUT OF THE GATHERING DARKNESS WAVERED TRAGICALLY FOR A MOMENT AND THEN DISAPPEARED AROUND THE NEXT BEND MAVRO MICHAELIS WASNT EVEN SURE OF ITS COLOUR HE TOLD THE FIRST POLICEMAN THAT IT WAS LIGHT GREEN THE OTHER CAR THE ONE GOING TOWARD NEW YORK CAME TO REST A HUNDRED YARDS BEYOND AND ITS DRIVER HURRIED BACK TO WHERE MYRTLE WILSON HER LIFE VIOLENTLY EXTINGUISHED KNELT IN THE ROAD AND MINGLED HER THICK DARK BLOOD WITH THE DUST MICHAELIS AND THIS MAN REACHED HER FIRST BUT WHEN THEY HAD TORN OPEN HER SHIRTWAIST STILL DAMP WITH PERSPIRATION THEY SAW THAT HER LEFT BREAST WAS SWINGING LOOSE LIKE A FLAP AND THERE WAS NO NEED TO LISTEN FOR THE HEART BENEATH THE MOUTH WAS WIDE OPEN AND RIPPED A LITTLE AT THE CORNERS AS THOUGH SHE HAD CHOKED A LITTLE IN GIVING UP THE TREMENDOUS VITALITY SHE HAD STORED SO LONG WE SAW THE THREE OR FOUR AUTOMOBILES AND THE CROWD WHEN WE WERE STILL SOME DISTANCE AWAY WRECK SAID TOM THATS GOOD WILSONLL HAVE A LITTLE BUSINESS AT LAST HE SLOWED DOWN BUT STILL WITHOUT ANY INTENTION OF STOPPING UNTIL AS WE CAME NEARER THE HUSHED INTENT FACES OF THE PEOPLE AT THE GARAGE DOOR MADE HIM AUTOMATICALLY PUT ON THE BRAKES WELL TAKE A LOOK HE SAID DOUBTFULLY JUST A LOOK I BECAME AWARE NOW OF A HOLLOW WAILING SOUND WHICH ISSUED INCESSANTLY FROM THE GARAGE A SOUND WHICH AS WE GOT OUT OF THE COUPé AND WALKED TOWARD THE DOOR RESOLVED ITSELF INTO THE WORDS OH MY GOD UTTERED OVER AND OVER IN A GASPING MOAN THERES SOME BAD TROUBLE HERE SAID TOM EXCITEDLY HE REACHED UP ON TIPTOES AND PEERED OVER A CIRCLE OF HEADS INTO THE GARAGE WHICH WAS LIT ONLY BY A YELLOW LIGHT IN A SWINGING METAL BASKET OVERHEAD THEN HE MADE A HARSH SOUND IN HIS THROAT AND WITH A VIOLENT THRUSTING MOVEMENT OF HIS POWERFUL ARMS PUSHED HIS WAY THROUGH THE CIRCLE CLOSED UP AGAIN WITH A RUNNING MURMUR OF EXPOSTULATION IT WAS A MINUTE BEFORE I COULD SEE ANYTHING AT ALL THEN NEW ARRIVALS DERANGED THE LINE AND JORDAN AND I WERE PUSHED SUDDENLY INSIDE MYRTLE WILSONS BODY WRAPPED IN A BLANKET AND THEN IN ANOTHER BLANKET AS THOUGH SHE SUFFERED FROM A CHILL IN THE HOT NIGHT LAY ON A WORKTABLE BY THE WALL AND TOM WITH HIS BACK TO US WAS BENDING OVER IT MOTIONLESS NEXT TO HIM STOOD A MOTORCYCLE POLICEMAN TAKING DOWN NAMES WITH MUCH SWEAT AND CORRECTION IN A LITTLE BOOK AT FIRST I COULDNT FIND THE SOURCE OF THE HIGH GROANING WORDS THAT ECHOED CLAMOROUSLY THROUGH THE BARE GARAGE THEN I SAW WILSON STANDING ON THE RAISED THRESHOLD OF HIS OFFICE SWAYING BACK AND FORTH AND HOLDING TO THE DOORPOSTS WITH BOTH HANDS SOME MAN WAS TALKING TO HIM IN A LOW VOICE AND ATTEMPTING FROM TIME TO TIME TO LAY A HAND ON HIS SHOULDER BUT WILSON NEITHER HEARD NOR SAW HIS EYES WOULD DROP SLOWLY FROM THE SWINGING LIGHT TO THE LADEN TABLE BY THE WALL AND THEN JERK BACK TO THE LIGHT AGAIN AND HE GAVE OUT INCESSANTLY HIS HIGH HORRIBLE CALL OH MY GAOD OH MY GAOD OH GAOD OH MY GAOD PRESENTLY TOM LIFTED HIS HEAD WITH A JERK AND AFTER STARING AROUND THE GARAGE WITH GLAZED EYES ADDRESSED A MUMBLED INCOHERENT REMARK TO THE POLICEMAN MAV THE POLICEMAN WAS SAYING O NO R CORRECTED THE MAN MAVRO LISTEN TO ME MUTTERED TOM FIERCELY R SAID THE POLICEMAN O G G HE LOOKED UP AS TOMS

THREE BRIGHT WINDOWS DOWNSTAIRS AND THE PINK GLOW FROM DAISYS ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR YOU WAIT HERE I SAID ILL SEE IF THERES ANY SIGN OF A COMMOTION I WALKED BACK ALONG THE BORDER OF THE LAWN TRAVERSED THE GRAVEL SOFTLY AND TIPTOED UP THE VERANDA STEPS THE DRAWINGROOM CURTAINS WERE OPEN AND I SAW THAT THE ROOM WAS EMPTY CROSSING THE PORCH WHERE WE HAD DINED THAT JUNE NIGHT THREE MONTHS BEFORE I CAME TO A SMALL RECTANGLE OF LIGHT WHICH I GUESSED WAS THE PANTRY WINDOW THE BLIND WAS DRAWN BUT I FOUND A RIFT AT THE SILL DAISY AND TOM WERE SITTING OPPOSITE EACH OTHER AT THE KITCHEN TABLE WITH A PLATE OF COLD FRIED CHICKEN BETWEEN THEM AND TWO BOTTLES OF ALE HE WAS TALKING INTENTLY ACROSS THE TABLE AT HER AND IN HIS EARNESTNESS HIS HAND HAD FALLEN UPON AND COVERED HER OWN ONCE IN A WHILE SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM AND NODDED IN AGREEMENT THEY WERENT HAPPY AND NEITHER OF THEM HAD TOUCHED THE CHICKEN OR THE ALE AND YET THEY WERENT UNHAPPY EITHER THERE WAS AN UNMISTAKABLE AIR OF NATURAL INTIMACY ABOUT THE PICTURE AND ANYBODY WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THEY WERE CONSPIRING TOGETHER AS I TIPTOED FROM THE PORCH I HEARD MY TAXI FEELING ITS WAY ALONG THE DARK ROAD TOWARD THE HOUSE GATSBY WAS WAITING WHERE I HAD LEFT HIM IN THE DRIVE IS IT ALL QUIET UP THERE HE ASKED ANXIOUSLY YES ITS ALL QUIET I HESITATED YOUD BETTER COME HOME AND GET SOME SLEEP HE SHOOK HIS HEAD I WANT TO WAIT HERE TILL DAISY GOES TO BED GOOD NIGHT OLD SPORT HE PUT HIS HANDS IN HIS COAT POCKETS AND TURNED BACK EAGERLY TO HIS SCRUTINY OF THE HOUSE AS THOUGH MY PRESENCE MARRED THE SACREDNESS OF THE VIGIL SO I WALKED AWAY AND LEFT HIM STANDING THERE IN THE MOONLIGHT WATCHING OVER NOTHING VIII I COULDNT SLEEP ALL NIGHT A FOGHORN WAS GROANING INCESSANTLY ON THE SOUND AND I TOSSED HALFSICK BETWEEN GROTESQUE REALITY AND SAVAGE FRIGHTENING DREAMS TOWARD DAWN I HEARD A TAXI GO UP GATSBYS DRIVE AND IMMEDIATELY I JUMPED OUT OF BED AND BEGAN TO DRESS I FELT THAT I HAD SOMETHING TO TELL HIM SOMETHING TO WARN HIM ABOUT AND MORNING WOULD BE TOO LATE CROSSING HIS LAWN I SAW THAT HIS FRONT DOOR WAS STILL OPEN AND HE WAS LEANING AGAINST A TABLE IN THE HALL HEAVY WITH DEJECTION OR SLEEP NOTHING HAPPENED HE SAID WANLY I WAITED AND ABOUT FOUR OCLOCK SHE CAME TO THE WINDOW AND STOOD THERE FOR A MINUTE AND THEN TURNED OUT THE LIGHT HIS HOUSE HAD NEVER SEEMED SO ENORMOUS TO ME AS IT DID THAT NIGHT WHEN WE HUNTED THROUGH THE GREAT ROOMS FOR CIGARETTES WE PUSHED ASIDE CURTAINS THAT WERE LIKE PAVILIONS AND FELT OVER INNUMERABLE FEET OF DARK WALL FOR ELECTRIC LIGHT SWITCHES ONCE I TUMBLED WITH A SORT OF SPLASH UPON THE KEYS OF A GHOSTLY PIANO THERE WAS AN INEXPLICABLE AMOUNT OF DUST EVERYWHERE AND THE ROOMS WERE MUSTY AS THOUGH THEY HADNT BEEN AIRED FOR MANY DAYS I FOUND THE HUMIDOR ON AN UNFAMILIAR TABLE WITH TWO STALE DRY CIGARETTES INSIDE THROWING OPEN THE FRENCH WINDOWS OF THE DRAWINGROOM WE SAT SMOKING OUT INTO THE DARKNESS YOU OUGHT TO GO AWAY I SAID ITS PRETTY CERTAIN THEYLL TRACE YOUR CAR GO AWAY NOW OLD SPORT GO TO ATLANTIC CITY FOR A WEEK OR UP TO MONTREAL HE WOULDNT CONSIDER IT HE COULDNT POSSIBLY LEAVE DAISY UNTIL HE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO HE WAS CLUTCHING AT SOME LAST HOPE AND I COULDNT BEAR TO SHAKE HIM FREE IT WAS THIS NIGHT THAT HE TOLD ME THE STRANGE STORY OF HIS YOUTH WITH DAN CODY TOLD IT TO ME BECAUSE JAY GATSBY HAD BROKEN UP LIKE GLASS AGAINST TOMS HARD MALICE AND THE LONG SECRET EXTRAVAGANZA WAS PLAYED OUT I THINK THAT HE WOULD HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED ANYTHING NOW WITHOUT RESERVE BUT HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT DAISY SHE WAS THE FIRST NICE GIRL HE HAD EVER KNOWN IN VARIOUS UNREVEALED CAPACITIES HE HAD COME IN CONTACT WITH SUCH PEOPLE BUT ALWAYS WITH INDISCERNIBLE BARBED WIRE BETWEEN HE FOUND HER EXCITINGLY DESIRABLE HE WENT TO HER HOUSE AT FIRST WITH OTHER OFFICERS FROM CAMP TAYLOR THEN ALONE IT AMAZED HIM HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE BEFORE BUT WHAT GAVE IT AN AIR OF BREATHLESS INTENSITY WAS THAT DAISY LIVED THERE IT WAS AS CASUAL A THING TO HER AS HIS TENT OUT AT CAMP WAS TO HIM THERE WAS A RIPE MYSTERY ABOUT IT A HINT OF BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS MORE BEAUTIFUL AND COOL THAN OTHER BEDROOMS OF GAY AND RADIANT ACTIVITIES TAKING PLACE THROUGH ITS CORRIDORS AND OF ROMANCES THAT WERE NOT MUSTY AND LAID AWAY ALREADY IN LAVENDER BUT FRESH AND BREATHING AND REDOLENT OF THIS YEARS SHINING MOTORCARS AND OF DANCES WHOSE FLOWERS WERE SCARCELY WITHERED IT EXCITED HIM TOO THAT MANY MEN HAD ALREADY LOVED DAISY IT INCREASED HER VALUE IN HIS EYES HE FELT THEIR PRESENCE ALL ABOUT THE HOUSE PERVADING THE AIR WITH THE SHADES AND ECHOES OF STILL VIBRANT EMOTIONS BUT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS IN DAISYS HOUSE BY A COLOSSAL ACCIDENT HOWEVER GLORIOUS MIGHT BE HIS FUTURE AS JAY GATSBY HE WAS AT PRESENT A PENNILESS YOUNG MAN WITHOUT A PAST AND AT ANY MOMENT THE INVISIBLE CLOAK OF HIS UNIFORM MIGHT SLIP FROM HIS SHOULDERS SO HE MADE THE MOST OF HIS TIME HE TOOK WHAT HE COULD GET RAVENOUSLY AND UNSCRUPULOUSLY EVENTUALLY HE TOOK DAISY ONE STILL OCTOBER NIGHT TOOK HER BECAUSE HE HAD NO REAL RIGHT TO TOUCH HER HAND HE MIGHT HAVE DESPISED HIMSELF FOR HE HAD CERTAINLY TAKEN HER UNDER FALSE PRETENCES I DONT MEAN THAT HE HAD TRADED ON HIS PHANTOM MILLIONS BUT HE HAD DELIBERATELY GIVEN DAISY A SENSE OF SECURITY HE LET HER BELIEVE THAT HE WAS A PERSON FROM MUCH THE SAME STRATA AS HERSELF THAT HE WAS FULLY ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HER AS A MATTER OF FACT HE HAD NO SUCH FACILITIES HE HAD NO COMFORTABLE FAMILY STANDING BEHIND HIM AND HE WAS LIABLE AT THE WHIM OF AN IMPERSONAL GOVERNMENT TO BE BLOWN ANYWHERE ABOUT THE WORLD BUT HE DIDNT DESPISE HIMSELF AND IT DIDNT TURN OUT AS HE HAD IMAGINED HE HAD INTENDED PROBABLY TO TAKE WHAT HE COULD AND GO BUT NOW HE FOUND THAT HE HAD COMMITTED HIMSELF TO THE FOLLOWING OF A GRAIL HE KNEW THAT DAISY WAS EXTRAORDINARY BUT HE DIDNT REALIZE JUST HOW EXTRAORDINARY A NICE GIRL COULD BE SHE VANISHED INTO HER RICH HOUSE INTO HER RICH FULL LIFE LEAVING GATSBY NOTHING HE FELT MARRIED TO HER THAT WAS ALL WHEN THEY MET AGAIN TWO DAYS LATER IT WAS GATSBY WHO WAS BREATHLESS WHO WAS SOMEHOW BETRAYED HER PORCH WAS BRIGHT WITH THE BOUGHT LUXURY OF STARSHINE THE WICKER OF THE SETTEE SQUEAKED FASHIONABLY AS SHE TURNED TOWARD HIM AND HE KISSED HER CURIOUS AND LOVELY MOUTH SHE HAD CAUGHT A COLD AND IT MADE HER VOICE HUSKIER AND MORE CHARMING THAN EVER AND GATSBY WAS OVERWHELMINGLY AWARE OF THE YOUTH AND MYSTERY THAT WEALTH IMPRISONS AND PRESERVES OF THE FRESHNESS OF MANY CLOTHES AND OF DAISY GLEAMING LIKE SILVER SAFE AND PROUD ABOVE THE HOT STRUGGLES OF THE POOR I CANT DESCRIBE TO YOU HOW SURPRISED I WAS TO FIND OUT I LOVED HER OLD SPORT I EVEN HOPED FOR A WHILE THAT SHED THROW ME OVER BUT SHE DIDNT BECAUSE SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH ME TOO SHE THOUGHT I KNEW A LOT BECAUSE I KNEW DIFFERENT THINGS FROM HER WELL THERE I WAS WAY OFF MY AMBITIONS GETTING DEEPER IN LOVE EVERY MINUTE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I DIDNT CARE WHAT WAS THE USE OF DOING GREAT THINGS IF I COULD HAVE A BETTER TIME TELLING HER WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO ON THE LAST AFTERNOON BEFORE HE WENT ABROAD HE SAT WITH DAISY IN HIS ARMS FOR A LONG SILENT TIME IT WAS A COLD FALL DAY WITH FIRE IN THE ROOM AND HER CHEEKS FLUSHED NOW AND THEN SHE MOVED AND HE CHANGED HIS ARM A LITTLE AND ONCE HE KISSED HER DARK SHINING HAIR THE AFTERNOON HAD MADE THEM TRANQUIL FOR A WHILE AS IF TO GIVE THEM A DEEP MEMORY FOR THE LONG PARTING THE NEXT DAY PROMISED THEY HAD NEVER BEEN CLOSER IN THEIR MONTH OF LOVE NOR COMMUNICATED MORE PROFOUNDLY ONE WITH ANOTHER THAN WHEN SHE BRUSHED SILENT LIPS AGAINST HIS COATS SHOULDER OR WHEN HE TOUCHED THE END OF HER FINGERS GENTLY AS THOUGH SHE WERE ASLEEP HE DID EXTRAORDINARILY WELL IN THE WAR HE WAS A CAPTAIN BEFORE HE WENT TO THE FRONT AND FOLLOWING THE ARGONNE BATTLES HE GOT HIS MAJORITY AND THE COMMAND OF THE DIVISIONAL MACHINEGUNS AFTER THE ARMISTICE HE TRIED FRANTICALLY TO GET HOME BUT SOME COMPLICATION OR MISUNDERSTANDING SENT HIM TO OXFORD INSTEAD HE WAS WORRIED NOW THERE WAS A QUALITY OF NERVOUS DESPAIR IN DAISYS LETTERS SHE DIDNT SEE WHY HE COULDNT COME SHE WAS FEELING THE PRESSURE OF THE WORLD OUTSIDE AND SHE WANTED TO SEE HIM AND FEEL HIS PRESENCE BESIDE HER AND BE REASSURED THAT SHE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING AFTER ALL FOR DAISY WAS YOUNG AND HER ARTIFICIAL WORLD WAS REDOLENT OF ORCHIDS AND PLEASANT CHEERFUL SNOBBERY AND ORCHESTRAS WHICH SET THE RHYTHM OF THE YEAR SUMMING UP THE SADNESS AND SUGGESTIVENESS OF LIFE IN NEW TUNES ALL NIGHT THE SAXOPHONES WAILED THE HOPELESS COMMENT OF THE BEALE STREET BLUES WHILE A HUNDRED PAIRS OF GOLDEN AND SILVER SLIPPERS SHUFFLED THE SHINING DUST AT THE GREY TEA HOUR THERE WERE ALWAYS ROOMS THAT THROBBED INCESSANTLY WITH THIS LOW SWEET FEVER WHILE FRESH FACES DRIFTED HERE AND THERE LIKE ROSE PETALS BLOWN BY THE SAD HORNS AROUND THE FLOOR THROUGH THIS TWILIGHT UNIVERSE DAISY BEGAN TO MOVE AGAIN WITH THE SEASON SUDDENLY SHE WAS AGAIN KEEPING HALF A DOZEN DATES A DAY WITH HALF A DOZEN MEN AND DROWSING ASLEEP AT DAWN WITH THE BEADS AND CHIFFON OF AN EVENINGDRESS TANGLED AMONG DYING ORCHIDS ON THE FLOOR BESIDE HER BED AND ALL THE TIME SOMETHING WITHIN HER WAS CRYING FOR A DECISION SHE WANTED HER LIFE SHAPED NOW IMMEDIATELY AND THE DECISION MUST BE MADE BY SOME FORCE OF LOVE OF MONEY OF UNQUESTIONABLE PRACTICALITY THAT WAS CLOSE AT HAND THAT FORCE TOOK SHAPE IN THE MIDDLE OF SPRING WITH THE ARRIVAL OF TOM BUCHANAN THERE WAS A WHOLESOME BULKINESS ABOUT HIS PERSON AND HIS POSITION AND DAISY WAS FLATTERED DOUBTLESS THERE WAS A CERTAIN STRUGGLE AND A CERTAIN RELIEF THE LETTER REACHED GATSBY WHILE HE WAS STILL AT OXFORD IT WAS DAWN NOW ON LONG ISLAND AND WE WENT ABOUT OPENING THE REST OF THE WINDOWS DOWNSTAIRS FILLING THE HOUSE WITH GREYTURNING GOLDTURNING LIGHT THE SHADOW OF A TREE FELL ABRUPTLY ACROSS THE DEW AND GHOSTLY BIRDS BEGAN TO SING AMONG THE BLUE LEAVES THERE WAS A SLOW PLEASANT MOVEMENT IN THE AIR SCARCELY A WIND PROMISING A COOL LOVELY DAY I DONT THINK SHE EVER LOVED HIM GATSBY TURNED AROUND FROM A WINDOW AND LOOKED AT ME CHALLENGINGLY YOU MUST REMEMBER OLD SPORT SHE WAS VERY EXCITED THIS AFTERNOON HE TOLD HER THOSE THINGS IN A WAY THAT FRIGHTENED HER THAT MADE IT LOOK AS IF I WAS SOME KIND OF CHEAP SHARPER AND THE RESULT WAS SHE HARDLY KNEW WHAT SHE WAS SAYING HE SAT DOWN GLOOMILY OF COURSE SHE MIGHT HAVE LOVED HIM JUST FOR A MINUTE WHEN THEY WERE FIRST MARRIED AND LOVED ME MORE EVEN THEN DO YOU SEE SUDDENLY HE CAME OUT WITH A CURIOUS REMARK IN ANY CASE HE SAID IT WAS JUST PERSONAL WHAT COULD YOU MAKE OF THAT EXCEPT TO SUSPECT SOME INTENSITY IN HIS CONCEPTION OF THE AFFAIR THAT COULDNT BE MEASURED HE CAME BACK FROM FRANCE WHEN TOM AND DAISY WERE STILL ON THEIR WEDDING TRIP AND MADE A MISERABLE BUT IRRESISTIBLE JOURNEY TO LOUISVILLE ON THE LAST OF HIS ARMY PAY HE STAYED THERE A WEEK WALKING THE STREETS WHERE THEIR FOOTSTEPS HAD CLICKED TOGETHER THROUGH THE NOVEMBER NIGHT AND REVISITING THE OUTOFTHEWAY PLACES TO WHICH THEY HAD DRIVEN IN HER WHITE CAR JUST AS DAISYS HOUSE HAD ALWAYS SEEMED TO HIM MORE MYSTERIOUS AND GAY THAN OTHER HOUSES SO HIS IDEA OF THE CITY ITSELF EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS GONE FROM IT WAS PERVADED WITH A MELANCHOLY BEAUTY HE LEFT FEELING THAT IF HE HAD SEARCHED HARDER HE MIGHT HAVE FOUND HER THAT HE WAS LEAVING HER BEHIND THE DAYCOACH HE WAS PENNILESS NOW WAS HOT HE WENT OUT TO THE OPEN VESTIBULE AND SAT DOWN ON A FOLDINGCHAIR AND THE STATION SLID AWAY AND THE BACKS OF UNFAMILIAR BUILDINGS MOVED BY THEN OUT INTO THE SPRING FIELDS WHERE A YELLOW TROLLEY RACED THEM FOR A MINUTE WITH PEOPLE IN IT WHO MIGHT ONCE HAVE SEEN THE PALE MAGIC OF HER FACE ALONG THE CASUAL STREET THE TRACK CURVED AND NOW IT WAS GOING AWAY FROM THE SUN WHICH AS IT SANK LOWER SEEMED TO SPREAD ITSELF IN BENEDICTION OVER THE VANISHING CITY WHERE SHE HAD DRAWN HER BREATH HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND DESPERATELY AS IF TO SNATCH ONLY A WISP OF AIR TO SAVE A FRAGMENT OF THE SPOT THAT SHE HAD MADE LOVELY FOR HIM BUT IT WAS ALL GOING BY TOO FAST NOW FOR HIS BLURRED EYES AND HE KNEW THAT HE HAD LOST THAT PART OF IT THE FRESHEST AND THE BEST FOREVER IT WAS NINE OCLOCK WHEN WE FINISHED BREAKFAST AND WENT OUT ON THE PORCH THE NIGHT HAD MADE A SHARP DIFFERENCE IN THE WEATHER AND THERE WAS AN AUTUMN FLAVOUR IN THE AIR THE GARDENER THE LAST ONE OF GATSBYS FORMER SERVANTS CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE STEPS IM GOING TO DRAIN THE POOL TODAY MR GATSBY LEAVESLL START FALLING PRETTY SOON AND THEN

WHOLE DAMN BUNCH PUT TOGETHER IVE ALWAYS BEEN GLAD I SAID THAT IT WAS THE ONLY COMPLIMENT I EVER GAVE HIM BECAUSE I DISAPPROVED OF HIM FROM BEGINNING TO END FIRST HE NODDED POLITELY AND THEN HIS FACE BROKE INTO THAT RADIANT AND UNDERSTANDING SMILE AS IF WED BEEN IN ECSTATIC CAHOOTS ON THAT FACT ALL THE TIME HIS GORGEOUS PINK RAG OF A SUIT MADE A BRIGHT SPOT OF COLOUR AGAINST THE WHITE STEPS AND I THOUGHT OF THE NIGHT WHEN I FIRST CAME TO HIS ANCESTRAL HOME THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE LAWN AND DRIVE HAD BEEN CROWDED WITH THE FACES OF THOSE WHO GUESSED AT HIS CORRUPTION AND HE HAD STOOD ON THOSE STEPS CONCEALING HIS INCORRUPTIBLE DREAM AS HE WAVED THEM GOODBYE I THANKED HIM FOR HIS HOSPITALITY WE WERE ALWAYS THANKING HIM FOR THAT I AND THE OTHERS GOODBYE I CALLED I ENJOYED BREAKFAST GATSBY UP IN THE CITY I TRIED FOR A WHILE TO LIST THE QUOTATIONS ON AN INTERMINABLE AMOUNT OF STOCK THEN I FELL ASLEEP IN MY SWIVELCHAIR JUST BEFORE NOON THE PHONE WOKE ME AND I STARTED UP WITH SWEAT BREAKING OUT ON MY FOREHEAD IT WAS JORDAN BAKER SHE OFTEN CALLED ME UP AT THIS HOUR BECAUSE THE UNCERTAINTY OF HER OWN MOVEMENTS BETWEEN HOTELS AND CLUBS AND PRIVATE HOUSES MADE HER HARD TO FIND IN ANY OTHER WAY USUALLY HER VOICE CAME OVER THE WIRE AS SOMETHING FRESH AND COOL AS IF A DIVOT FROM A GREEN GOLFLINKS HAD COME SAILING IN AT THE OFFICE WINDOW BUT THIS MORNING IT SEEMED HARSH AND DRY IVE LEFT DAISYS HOUSE SHE SAID IM AT HEMPSTEAD AND IM GOING DOWN TO SOUTHAMPTON THIS AFTERNOON PROBABLY IT HAD BEEN TACTFUL TO LEAVE DAISYS HOUSE BUT THE ACT ANNOYED ME AND HER NEXT REMARK MADE ME RIGID YOU WERENT SO NICE TO ME LAST NIGHT HOW COULD IT HAVE MATTERED THEN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT THEN HOWEVER I WANT TO SEE YOU I WANT TO SEE YOU TOO SUPPOSE I DONT GO TO SOUTHAMPTON AND COME INTO TOWN THIS AFTERNOON NO I DONT THINK THIS AFTERNOON VERY WELL ITS IMPOSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON VARIOUS WE TALKED LIKE THAT FOR A WHILE AND THEN ABRUPTLY WE WERENT TALKING ANY LONGER I DONT KNOW WHICH OF US HUNG UP WITH A SHARP CLICK BUT I KNOW I DIDNT CARE I COULDNT HAVE TALKED TO HER ACROSS A TEATABLE THAT DAY IF I NEVER TALKED TO HER AGAIN IN THIS WORLD I CALLED GATSBYS HOUSE A FEW MINUTES LATER BUT THE LINE WAS BUSY I TRIED FOUR TIMES FINALLY AN EXASPERATED CENTRAL TOLD ME THE WIRE WAS BEING KEPT OPEN FOR LONG DISTANCE FROM DETROIT TAKING OUT MY TIMETABLE I DREW A SMALL CIRCLE AROUND THE THREEFIFTY TRAIN THEN I LEANED BACK IN MY CHAIR AND TRIED TO THINK IT WAS JUST NOON WHEN I PASSED THE ASHHEAPS ON THE TRAIN THAT MORNING I HAD CROSSED DELIBERATELY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAR I SUPPOSED THERED BE A CURIOUS CROWD AROUND THERE ALL DAY WITH LITTLE BOYS SEARCHING FOR DARK SPOTS IN THE DUST AND SOME GARRULOUS MAN TELLING OVER AND OVER WHAT HAD HAPPENED UNTIL IT BECAME LESS AND LESS REAL EVEN TO HIM AND HE COULD TELL IT NO LONGER AND MYRTLE WILSONS TRAGIC ACHIEVEMENT WAS FORGOTTEN NOW I WANT TO GO BACK A LITTLE AND TELL WHAT HAPPENED AT THE GARAGE AFTER WE LEFT THERE THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY HAD DIFFICULTY IN LOCATING THE SISTER CATHERINE SHE MUST HAVE BROKEN HER RULE AGAINST DRINKING THAT NIGHT FOR WHEN SHE ARRIVED SHE WAS STUPID WITH LIQUOR AND UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE AMBULANCE HAD ALREADY GONE TO FLUSHING WHEN THEY CONVINCED HER OF THIS SHE IMMEDIATELY FAINTED AS IF THAT WAS THE INTOLERABLE PART OF THE AFFAIR SOMEONE KIND OR CURIOUS TOOK HER IN HIS CAR AND DROVE HER IN THE WAKE OF HER SISTERS BODY UNTIL LONG AFTER MIDNIGHT A CHANGING CROWD LAPPED UP AGAINST THE FRONT OF THE GARAGE WHILE GEORGE WILSON ROCKED HIMSELF BACK AND FORTH ON THE COUCH INSIDE FOR A WHILE THE DOOR OF THE OFFICE WAS OPEN AND EVERYONE WHO CAME INTO THE GARAGE GLANCED IRRESISTIBLY THROUGH IT FINALLY SOMEONE SAID IT WAS A SHAME AND CLOSED THE DOOR MICHAELIS AND SEVERAL OTHER MEN WERE WITH HIM FIRST FOUR OR FIVE MEN LATER TWO OR THREE MEN STILL LATER MICHAELIS HAD TO ASK THE LAST STRANGER TO WAIT THERE FIFTEEN MINUTES LONGER WHILE HE WENT BACK TO HIS OWN PLACE AND MADE A POT OF COFFEE AFTER THAT HE STAYED THERE ALONE WITH WILSON UNTIL DAWN ABOUT THREE OCLOCK THE QUALITY OF WILSONS INCOHERENT MUTTERING CHANGED HE GREW QUIETER AND BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT THE YELLOW CAR HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD A WAY OF FINDING OUT WHOM THE YELLOW CAR BELONGED TO AND THEN HE BLURTED OUT THAT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO HIS WIFE HAD COME FROM THE CITY WITH HER FACE BRUISED AND HER NOSE SWOLLEN BUT WHEN HE HEARD HIMSELF SAY THIS HE FLINCHED AND BEGAN TO CRY OH MY GOD AGAIN IN HIS GROANING VOICE MICHAELIS MADE A CLUMSY ATTEMPT TO DISTRACT HIM HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN MARRIED GEORGE COME ON THERE TRY AND SIT STILL A MINUTE AND ANSWER MY QUESTION HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN MARRIED TWELVE YEARS EVER HAD ANY CHILDREN COME ON GEORGE SIT STILL I ASKED YOU A QUESTION DID YOU EVER HAVE ANY CHILDREN THE HARD BROWN BEETLES KEPT THUDDING AGAINST THE DULL LIGHT AND WHENEVER MICHAELIS HEARD A CAR GO TEARING ALONG THE ROAD OUTSIDE IT SOUNDED TO HIM LIKE THE CAR THAT HADNT STOPPED A FEW HOURS BEFORE HE DIDNT LIKE TO GO INTO THE GARAGE BECAUSE THE WORK BENCH WAS STAINED WHERE THE BODY HAD BEEN LYING SO HE MOVED UNCOMFORTABLY AROUND THE OFFICE HE KNEW EVERY OBJECT IN IT BEFORE MORNING AND FROM TIME TO TIME SAT DOWN BESIDE WILSON TRYING TO KEEP HIM MORE QUIET HAVE YOU GOT A CHURCH YOU GO TO SOMETIMES GEORGE MAYBE EVEN IF YOU HAVENT BEEN THERE FOR A LONG TIME MAYBE I COULD CALL UP THE CHURCH AND GET A PRIEST TO COME OVER AND HE COULD TALK TO YOU SEE DONT BELONG TO ANY YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A CHURCH GEORGE FOR TIMES LIKE THIS YOU MUST HAVE GONE TO CHURCH ONCE DIDNT YOU GET MARRIED IN A CHURCH LISTEN GEORGE LISTEN TO ME DIDNT YOU GET MARRIED IN A CHURCH THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO THE EFFORT OF ANSWERING BROKE THE RHYTHM OF HIS ROCKING FOR A MOMENT HE WAS SILENT THEN THE SAME HALFKNOWING HALFBEWILDERED LOOK CAME BACK INTO HIS FADED EYES LOOK IN THE DRAWER THERE HE SAID POINTING AT THE DESK WHICH DRAWER THAT DRAWER THAT ONE MICHAELIS OPENED THE DRAWER NEAREST HIS HAND THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT BUT A SMALL EXPENSIVE DOGLEASH MADE OF LEATHER AND BRAIDED SILVER IT WAS APPARENTLY NEW THIS HE INQUIRED HOLDING IT UP WILSON STARED AND NODDED I FOUND IT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON SHE TRIED TO TELL ME ABOUT IT BUT I KNEW IT WAS SOMETHING FUNNY YOU MEAN YOUR WIFE BOUGHT IT SHE HAD IT WRAPPED IN TISSUE PAPER ON HER BUREAU MICHAELIS DIDNT SEE ANYTHING ODD IN THAT AND HE GAVE WILSON A DOZEN REASONS WHY HIS WIFE MIGHT HAVE BOUGHT THE DOGLEASH BUT CONCEIVABLY WILSON HAD HEARD SOME OF THESE SAME EXPLANATIONS BEFORE FROM MYRTLE BECAUSE HE BEGAN SAYING OH MY GOD AGAIN IN A WHISPER HIS COMFORTER LEFT SEVERAL EXPLANATIONS IN THE AIR THEN HE KILLED HER SAID WILSON HIS MOUTH DROPPED OPEN SUDDENLY WHO DID I HAVE A WAY OF FINDING OUT YOURE MORBID GEORGE SAID HIS FRIEND THIS HAS BEEN A STRAIN TO YOU AND YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOURE SAYING YOUD BETTER TRY AND SIT QUIET TILL MORNING HE MURDERED HER IT WAS AN ACCIDENT GEORGE WILSON SHOOK HIS HEAD HIS EYES NARROWED AND HIS MOUTH WIDENED SLIGHTLY WITH THE GHOST OF A SUPERIOR HM I KNOW HE SAID DEFINITELY IM ONE OF THESE TRUSTING FELLAS AND I DONT THINK ANY HARM TO NOBODY BUT WHEN I GET TO KNOW A THING I KNOW IT IT WAS THE MAN IN THAT CAR SHE RAN OUT TO SPEAK TO HIM AND HE WOULDNT STOP MICHAELIS HAD SEEN THIS TOO BUT IT HADNT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THERE WAS ANY SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE IN IT HE BELIEVED THAT MRS WILSON HAD BEEN RUNNING AWAY FROM HER HUSBAND RATHER THAN TRYING TO STOP ANY PARTICULAR CAR HOW COULD SHE OF BEEN LIKE THAT SHES A DEEP ONE SAID WILSON AS IF THAT ANSWERED THE QUESTION AHHH HE BEGAN TO ROCK AGAIN AND MICHAELIS STOOD TWISTING THE LEASH IN HIS HAND MAYBE YOU GOT SOME FRIEND THAT I COULD TELEPHONE FOR GEORGE THIS WAS A FORLORN HOPE HE WAS ALMOST SURE THAT WILSON HAD NO FRIEND THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH OF HIM FOR HIS WIFE HE WAS GLAD A LITTLE LATER WHEN HE NOTICED A CHANGE IN THE ROOM A BLUE QUICKENING BY THE WINDOW AND REALIZED THAT DAWN WASNT FAR OFF ABOUT FIVE OCLOCK IT WAS BLUE ENOUGH OUTSIDE TO SNAP OFF THE LIGHT WILSONS GLAZED EYES TURNED OUT TO THE ASHHEAPS WHERE SMALL GREY CLOUDS TOOK ON FANTASTIC SHAPES AND SCURRIED HERE AND THERE IN THE FAINT DAWN WIND I SPOKE TO HER HE MUTTERED AFTER A LONG SILENCE I TOLD HER SHE MIGHT FOOL ME BUT SHE COULDNT FOOL GOD I TOOK HER TO THE WINDOW WITH AN EFFORT HE GOT UP AND WALKED TO THE REAR WINDOW AND LEANED WITH HIS FACE PRESSED AGAINST IT AND I SAID ‘GOD KNOWS WHAT YOUVE BEEN DOING EVERYTHING YOUVE BEEN DOING YOU MAY FOOL ME BUT YOU CANT FOOL GOD  STANDING BEHIND HIM MICHAELIS SAW WITH A SHOCK THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT THE EYES OF DOCTOR T J ECKLEBURG WHICH HAD JUST EMERGED PALE AND ENORMOUS FROM THE DISSOLVING NIGHT GOD SEES EVERYTHING REPEATED WILSON THATS AN ADVERTISEMENT MICHAELIS ASSURED HIM SOMETHING MADE HIM TURN AWAY FROM THE WINDOW AND LOOK BACK INTO THE ROOM BUT WILSON STOOD THERE A LONG TIME HIS FACE CLOSE TO THE WINDOW PANE NODDING INTO THE TWILIGHT BY SIX OCLOCK MICHAELIS WAS WORN OUT AND GRATEFUL FOR THE SOUND OF A CAR STOPPING OUTSIDE IT WAS ONE OF THE WATCHERS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE WHO HAD PROMISED TO COME BACK SO HE COOKED BREAKFAST FOR THREE WHICH HE AND THE OTHER MAN ATE TOGETHER WILSON WAS QUIETER NOW AND MICHAELIS WENT HOME TO SLEEP WHEN HE AWOKE FOUR HOURS LATER AND HURRIED BACK TO THE GARAGE WILSON WAS GONE HIS MOVEMENTS HE WAS ON FOOT ALL THE TIME WERE AFTERWARD TRACED TO PORT ROOSEVELT AND THEN TO GADS HILL WHERE HE BOUGHT A SANDWICH THAT HE DIDNT EAT AND A CUP OF COFFEE HE MUST HAVE BEEN TIRED AND WALKING SLOWLY FOR HE DIDNT REACH GADS HILL UNTIL NOON THUS FAR THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN ACCOUNTING FOR HIS TIME THERE WERE BOYS WHO HAD SEEN A MAN ACTING SORT OF CRAZY AND MOTORISTS AT WHOM HE STARED ODDLY FROM THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THEN FOR THREE HOURS HE DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW THE POLICE ON THE STRENGTH OF WHAT HE SAID TO MICHAELIS THAT HE HAD A WAY OF FINDING OUT SUPPOSED THAT HE SPENT THAT TIME GOING FROM GARAGE TO GARAGE THEREABOUT INQUIRING FOR A YELLOW CAR ON THE OTHER HAND NO GARAGE MAN WHO HAD SEEN HIM EVER CAME FORWARD AND PERHAPS HE HAD AN EASIER SURER WAY OF FINDING OUT WHAT HE WANTED TO KNOW BY HALFPAST TWO HE WAS IN WEST EGG WHERE HE ASKED SOMEONE THE WAY TO GATSBYS HOUSE SO BY THAT TIME HE KNEW GATSBYS NAME AT TWO OCLOCK GATSBY PUT ON HIS BATHINGSUIT AND LEFT WORD WITH THE BUTLER THAT IF ANYONE PHONED WORD WAS TO BE BROUGHT TO HIM AT THE POOL HE STOPPED AT THE GARAGE FOR A PNEUMATIC MATTRESS THAT HAD AMUSED HIS GUESTS DURING THE SUMMER AND THE CHAUFFEUR HELPED HIM TO PUMP IT UP THEN HE GAVE INSTRUCTIONS THAT THE OPEN CAR WASNT TO BE TAKEN OUT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THIS WAS STRANGE BECAUSE THE FRONT RIGHT FENDER NEEDED REPAIR GATSBY SHOULDERED THE MATTRESS AND STARTED FOR THE POOL ONCE HE STOPPED AND SHIFTED IT A LITTLE AND THE CHAUFFEUR ASKED HIM IF HE NEEDED HELP BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND IN A MOMENT DISAPPEARED AMONG THE YELLOWING TREES NO TELEPHONE MESSAGE ARRIVED BUT THE BUTLER WENT WITHOUT HIS SLEEP AND WAITED FOR IT UNTIL FOUR OCLOCK UNTIL LONG AFTER THERE WAS ANYONE TO GIVE IT TO IF IT CAME I HAVE AN IDEA THAT GATSBY HIMSELF DIDNT BELIEVE IT WOULD COME AND PERHAPS HE NO LONGER CARED IF THAT WAS TRUE HE MUST HAVE FELT THAT HE HAD LOST THE OLD WARM WORLD PAID A HIGH PRICE FOR LIVING TOO LONG WITH A SINGLE DREAM HE MUST HAVE LOOKED UP AT AN UNFAMILIAR SKY THROUGH FRIGHTENING LEAVES AND SHIVERED AS HE FOUND WHAT A GROTESQUE THING A ROSE IS AND HOW RAW THE SUNLIGHT WAS UPON THE SCARCELY CREATED GRASS A NEW WORLD MATERIAL WITHOUT BEING REAL WHERE POOR GHOSTS BREATHING DREAMS LIKE AIR DRIFTED FORTUITOUSLY ABOUT LIKE THAT ASHEN FANTASTIC FIGURE GLIDING TOWARD HIM THROUGH THE AMORPHOUS TREES THE CHAUFFEUR HE WAS ONE OF WOLFSHIEMS PROTéGéS HEARD THE SHOTS AFTERWARDS HE COULD ONLY SAY THAT HE HADNT THOUGHT ANYTHING MUCH ABOUT THEM I DROVE FROM THE STATION DIRECTLY TO GATSBYS HOUSE AND MY RUSHING ANXIOUSLY UP THE FRONT STEPS WAS THE FIRST THING THAT ALARMED ANYONE BUT THEY KNEW THEN I FIRMLY BELIEVE WITH SCARCELY A WORD SAID FOUR OF US THE CHAUFFEUR BUTLER GARDENER AND I HURRIED DOWN TO THE POOL THERE WAS A FAINT BARELY PERCEPTIBLE MOVEMENT OF THE WATER AS THE FRESH FLOW FROM ONE END URGED ITS WAY TOWARD THE DRAIN AT THE OTHER WITH LITTLE RIPPLES THAT WERE HARDLY THE SHADOWS OF WAVES THE LADEN MATTRESS MOVED IRREGULARLY DOWN THE POOL A SMALL GUST OF WIND THAT SCARCELY CORRUGATED THE SURFACE WAS ENOUGH TO DISTURB ITS ACCIDENTAL COURSE WITH ITS ACCIDENTAL BURDEN THE TOUCH OF A CLUSTER OF LEAVES REVOLVED IT SLOWLY TRACING LIKE THE LEG OF TRANSIT A THIN RED CIRCLE IN THE WATER IT WAS AFTER WE STARTED WITH GATSBY TOWARD THE HOUSE THAT THE GARDENER SAW WILSONS BODY A LITTLE WAY OFF IN THE GRASS AND THE HOLOCAUST WAS COMPLETE IX AFTER TWO YEARS I REMEMBER THE REST OF THAT DAY AND THAT NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY ONLY AS AN ENDLESS DRILL OF POLICE AND PHOTOGRAPHERS AND NEWSPAPER MEN IN AND OUT OF GATSBYS FRONT DOOR A ROPE STRETCHED ACROSS THE MAIN GATE AND A POLICEMAN BY IT KEPT OUT THE CURIOUS BUT LITTLE BOYS SOON DISCOVERED THAT THEY COULD ENTER THROUGH MY YARD AND THERE WERE ALWAYS A FEW OF THEM CLUSTERED OPENMOUTHED ABOUT THE POOL SOMEONE WITH A POSITIVE MANNER PERHAPS A DETECTIVE USED THE EXPRESSION MADMAN AS HE BENT OVER WILSONS BODY THAT AFTERNOON AND THE ADVENTITIOUS AUTHORITY OF HIS VOICE SET THE KEY FOR THE NEWSPAPER REPORTS NEXT MORNING MOST OF THOSE REPORTS WERE A NIGHTMARE GROTESQUE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EAGER AND UNTRUE WHEN MICHAELISS TESTIMONY AT THE INQUEST BROUGHT TO LIGHT WILSONS SUSPICIONS OF HIS WIFE I THOUGHT THE WHOLE TALE WOULD SHORTLY BE SERVED UP IN RACY PASQUINADE BUT CATHERINE WHO MIGHT HAVE SAID ANYTHING DIDNT SAY A WORD SHE SHOWED A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF CHARACTER ABOUT IT TOO LOOKED AT THE CORONER WITH DETERMINED EYES UNDER THAT CORRECTED BROW OF HERS AND SWORE THAT HER SISTER HAD NEVER SEEN GATSBY THAT HER SISTER WAS COMPLETELY HAPPY WITH HER HUSBAND THAT HER SISTER HAD BEEN INTO NO MISCHIEF WHATEVER SHE CONVINCED HERSELF OF IT AND CRIED INTO HER HANDKERCHIEF AS IF THE VERY SUGGESTION WAS MORE THAN SHE COULD ENDURE SO WILSON WAS REDUCED TO A MAN DERANGED BY GRIEF IN ORDER THAT THE CASE MIGHT REMAIN IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM AND IT RESTED THERE BUT ALL THIS PART OF IT SEEMED REMOTE AND UNESSENTIAL I FOUND MYSELF ON GATSBYS SIDE AND ALONE FROM THE MOMENT I TELEPHONED NEWS OF THE CATASTROPHE TO WEST EGG VILLAGE EVERY SURMISE ABOUT HIM AND EVERY PRACTICAL QUESTION WAS REFERRED TO ME AT FIRST I WAS SURPRISED AND CONFUSED THEN AS HE LAY IN HIS HOUSE AND DIDNT MOVE OR BREATHE OR SPEAK HOUR UPON HOUR IT GREW UPON ME THAT I WAS RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE WAS INTERESTED INTERESTED I MEAN WITH THAT INTENSE PERSONAL INTEREST TO WHICH EVERYONE HAS SOME VAGUE RIGHT AT THE END I CALLED UP DAISY HALF AN HOUR AFTER WE FOUND HIM CALLED HER INSTINCTIVELY AND WITHOUT HESITATION BUT SHE AND TOM HAD GONE AWAY EARLY THAT AFTERNOON AND TAKEN BAGGAGE WITH THEM LEFT NO ADDRESS NO SAY WHEN THEYD BE BACK NO ANY IDEA WHERE THEY ARE HOW I COULD REACH THEM I DONT KNOW CANT SAY I WANTED TO GET SOMEBODY FOR HIM I WANTED TO GO INTO THE ROOM WHERE HE LAY AND REASSURE HIM ILL GET SOMEBODY FOR YOU GATSBY DONT WORRY JUST TRUST ME AND ILL GET SOMEBODY FOR YOU MEYER WOLFSHIEMS NAME WASNT IN THE PHONE BOOK THE BUTLER GAVE ME HIS OFFICE ADDRESS ON BROADWAY AND I CALLED INFORMATION BUT BY THE TIME I HAD THE NUMBER IT WAS LONG AFTER FIVE AND NO ONE ANSWERED THE PHONE WILL YOU RING AGAIN IVE RUNG THREE TIMES ITS VERY IMPORTANT SORRY IM AFRAID NO ONES THERE I WENT BACK TO THE DRAWINGROOM AND THOUGHT FOR AN INSTANT THAT THEY WERE CHANCE VISITORS ALL THESE OFFICIAL PEOPLE WHO SUDDENLY FILLED IT BUT THOUGH THEY DREW BACK THE SHEET AND LOOKED AT GATSBY WITH SHOCKED EYES HIS PROTEST CONTINUED IN MY BRAIN LOOK HERE OLD SPORT YOUVE GOT TO GET SOMEBODY FOR ME YOUVE GOT TO TRY HARD I CANT GO THROUGH THIS ALONE SOMEONE STARTED TO ASK ME QUESTIONS BUT I BROKE AWAY AND GOING UPSTAIRS LOOKED HASTILY THROUGH THE UNLOCKED PARTS OF HIS DESK HED NEVER TOLD ME DEFINITELY THAT HIS PARENTS WERE DEAD BUT THERE WAS NOTHING ONLY THE PICTURE OF DAN CODY A TOKEN OF FORGOTTEN VIOLENCE STARING DOWN FROM THE WALL NEXT MORNING I SENT THE BUTLER TO NEW YORK WITH A LETTER TO WOLFSHIEM WHICH ASKED FOR INFORMATION AND URGED HIM TO COME OUT ON THE NEXT TRAIN THAT REQUEST SEEMED SUPERFLUOUS WHEN I WROTE IT I WAS SURE HED START WHEN HE SAW THE NEWSPAPERS JUST AS I WAS SURE THERED BE A WIRE FROM DAISY BEFORE NOON BUT NEITHER A WIRE NOR MR WOLFSHIEM ARRIVED NO ONE ARRIVED EXCEPT MORE POLICE AND PHOTOGRAPHERS AND NEWSPAPER MEN WHEN THE BUTLER BROUGHT BACK WOLFSHIEMS ANSWER I BEGAN TO HAVE A FEELING OF DEFIANCE OF SCORNFUL SOLIDARITY BETWEEN GATSBY AND ME AGAINST THEM ALL DEAR MR CARRAWAY THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE SHOCKS OF MY LIFE TO ME I HARDLY CAN BELIEVE IT THAT IT IS TRUE AT ALL SUCH A MAD ACT AS THAT MAN DID SHOULD MAKE US ALL THINK I CANNOT COME DOWN NOW AS I AM TIED UP IN SOME VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS AND CANNOT GET MIXED UP

ONLY THAT THE SENDER WAS LEAVING IMMEDIATELY AND TO POSTPONE THE FUNERAL UNTIL HE CAME IT WAS GATSBYS FATHER A SOLEMN OLD MAN VERY HELPLESS AND DISMAYED BUNDLED UP IN A LONG CHEAP ULSTER AGAINST THE

GETTING OFF HIS COAT HE WAS ON THE POINT OF COLLAPSE SO I TOOK HIM INTO THE MUSICROOM AND MADE HIM SIT DOWN WHILE I SENT FOR SOMETHING TO EAT BUT HE WOULDNT EAT AND THE GLASS OF MILK SPILLED FROM HIS

FRIENDSHIP FOR A MAN WHEN HE IS ALIVE AND NOT AFTER HE IS DEAD HE SUGGESTED AFTER THAT MY OWN RULE IS TO LET EVERYTHING ALONE WHEN I LEFT HIS OFFICE THE SKY HAD TURNED DARK AND I GOT BACK TO WEST EGG

HE HAD SOMETHING TO SHOW ME JIMMY SENT ME THIS PICTURE HE TOOK OUT HIS WALLET WITH TREMBLING FINGERS LOOK THERE IT WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE HOUSE CRACKED IN THE CORNERS AND DIRTY WITH MANY HANDS HE POINTED OUT EVERY DETAIL TO ME EAGERLY LOOK THERE AND THEN SOUGHT ADMIRATION FROM MY EYES HE HAD SHOWN IT SO OFTEN THAT I THINK IT WAS MORE REAL TO HIM NOW THAN THE HOUSE ITSELF JIMMY SENT IT TO ME I THINK ITS A VERY PRETTY PICTURE IT SHOWS UP WELL VERY WELL HAD YOU SEEN HIM LATELY HE COME OUT TO SEE ME TWO YEARS AGO AND BOUGHT ME THE HOUSE I LIVE IN NOW OF COURSE WE WAS BROKE UP WHEN HE RUN OFF FROM HOME BUT I SEE NOW THERE WAS A REASON FOR IT HE KNEW HE HAD A BIG FUTURE IN FRONT OF HIM AND EVER SINCE HE MADE A SUCCESS HE WAS VERY GENEROUS WITH ME HE SEEMED RELUCTANT TO PUT AWAY THE PICTURE

COPY DOWN THE LIST FOR MY OWN USE A LITTLE BEFORE THREE THE LUTHERAN MINISTER ARRIVED FROM FLUSHING AND I BEGAN TO LOOK INVOLUNTARILY OUT THE WINDOWS FOR OTHER CARS SO DID GATSBYS FATHER AND AS THE TIME PASSED AND THE SERVANTS CAME IN AND STOOD WAITING IN THE HALL HIS EYES BEGAN TO BLINK ANXIOUSLY AND HE SPOKE OF THE RAIN IN A WORRIED UNCERTAIN WAY THE MINISTER GLANCED SEVERAL TIMES AT HIS WATCH SO I TOOK HIM ASIDE AND ASKED HIM TO WAIT FOR HALF AN HOUR BUT IT WASNT ANY USE NOBODY CAME ABOUT FIVE OCLOCK OUR PROCESSION OF THREE CARS REACHED THE CEMETERY AND STOPPED IN A THICK DRIZZLE BESIDE THE GATE FIRST A MOTOR HEARSE HORRIBLY BLACK AND WET THEN MR GATZ AND THE MINISTER AND ME IN THE LIMOUSINE AND A LITTLE LATER FOUR OR FIVE SERVANTS AND THE POSTMAN FROM WEST EGG IN GATSBYS STATION WAGON ALL WET TO THE SKIN AS WE STARTED THROUGH THE GATE INTO THE CEMETERY I HEARD A CAR STOP AND THEN THE SOUND OF SOMEONE SPLASHING AFTER US OVER THE SOGGY GROUND I LOOKED AROUND IT WAS THE MAN WITH OWLEYED GLASSES WHOM I HAD FOUND MARVELLING OVER GATSBYS BOOKS IN THE LIBRARY ONE NIGHT THREE MONTHS BEFORE ID NEVER SEEN HIM SINCE THEN I DONT KNOW HOW HE KNEW ABOUT THE FUNERAL OR EVEN HIS NAME THE RAIN POURED DOWN HIS THICK GLASSES AND HE TOOK THEM OFF AND WIPED THEM TO SEE THE PROTECTING CANVAS UNROLLED FROM GATSBYS GRAVE I TRIED TO THINK ABOUT GATSBY THEN FOR A MOMENT BUT HE WAS ALREADY TOO FAR AWAY AND I COULD ONLY REMEMBER WITHOUT RESENTMENT THAT DAISY HADNT SENT A MESSAGE OR A FLOWER DIMLY I HEARD SOMEONE MURMUR BLESSED ARE THE DEAD THAT THE RAIN FALLS ON AND THEN THE OWLEYED MAN SAID AMEN TO THAT IN A BRAVE VOICE WE STRAGGLED DOWN QUICKLY THROUGH THE RAIN TO THE CARS OWLEYES SPOKE TO ME BY THE GATE I COULDNT GET TO THE HOUSE HE REMARKED NEITHER COULD ANYBODY ELSE GO ON HE STARTED WHY MY GOD THEY USED TO GO THERE BY THE HUNDREDS HE TOOK OFF HIS GLASSES AND WIPED THEM AGAIN OUTSIDE AND IN THE POOR SONOFABITCH HE SAID ONE OF MY MOST VIVID MEMORIES IS OF COMING BACK WEST FROM PREP SCHOOL AND LATER FROM COLLEGE AT CHRISTMAS TIME THOSE WHO WENT FARTHER THAN CHICAGO WOULD GATHER IN THE OLD DIM UNION STATION AT SIX OCLOCK OF A DECEMBER EVENING WITH A FEW CHICAGO FRIENDS ALREADY CAUGHT UP INTO THEIR OWN HOLIDAY GAIETIES TO BID THEM A HASTY GOODBYE I REMEMBER THE FUR COATS OF THE GIRLS RETURNING FROM MISS THISORTHATS AND THE CHATTER OF FROZEN BREATH AND THE HANDS WAVING OVERHEAD AS WE CAUGHT SIGHT OF OLD ACQUAINTANCES AND THE MATCHINGS OF INVITATIONS ARE YOU GOING TO THE ORDWAYS THE HERSEYS THE SCHULTZES AND THE LONG GREEN TICKETS CLASPED TIGHT IN OUR GLOVED HANDS AND LAST THE MURKY YELLOW CARS OF THE CHICAGO MILWAUKEE AND ST PAUL RAILROAD LOOKING CHEERFUL AS CHRISTMAS ITSELF ON THE TRACKS BESIDE THE GATE WHEN WE PULLED OUT INTO THE WINTER NIGHT AND THE REAL SNOW OUR SNOW BEGAN TO STRETCH OUT BESIDE US AND TWINKLE AGAINST THE WINDOWS AND THE DIM LIGHTS OF SMALL WISCONSIN STATIONS MOVED BY A SHARP WILD BRACE CAME SUDDENLY INTO THE AIR WE DREW IN DEEP BREATHS OF IT AS WE WALKED BACK FROM DINNER THROUGH THE COLD VESTIBULES UNUTTERABLY AWARE OF OUR IDENTITY WITH THIS COUNTRY FOR ONE STRANGE HOUR BEFORE WE MELTED INDISTINGUISHABLY INTO IT AGAIN THATS MY MIDDLE WEST NOT THE WHEAT OR THE PRAIRIES OR THE LOST SWEDE TOWNS BUT THE THRILLING RETURNING TRAINS OF MY YOUTH AND THE STREET LAMPS AND SLEIGH BELLS IN THE FROSTY DARK AND THE SHADOWS OF HOLLY WREATHS THROWN BY LIGHTED WINDOWS ON THE SNOW I AM PART OF THAT A LITTLE SOLEMN WITH THE FEEL OF THOSE LONG WINTERS A LITTLE COMPLACENT FROM GROWING UP IN THE CARRAWAY HOUSE IN A CITY WHERE DWELLINGS ARE STILL CALLED THROUGH DECADES BY A FAMILYS NAME I SEE NOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN A STORY OF THE WEST AFTER ALL TOM AND GATSBY DAISY AND JORDAN AND I WERE ALL WESTERNERS AND PERHAPS WE POSSESSED SOME DEFICIENCY IN COMMON WHICH MADE US SUBTLY UNADAPTABLE TO EASTERN LIFE EVEN WHEN THE EAST EXCITED ME MOST EVEN WHEN I WAS MOST KEENLY AWARE OF ITS SUPERIORITY TO THE BORED SPRAWLING SWOLLEN TOWNS BEYOND THE OHIO WITH THEIR INTERMINABLE INQUISITIONS WHICH SPARED ONLY THE CHILDREN AND THE VERY OLD EVEN THEN IT HAD ALWAYS FOR ME A QUALITY OF DISTORTION WEST EGG ESPECIALLY STILL FIGURES IN MY MORE FANTASTIC DREAMS I SEE IT AS A NIGHT SCENE BY EL GRECO A HUNDRED HOUSES AT ONCE CONVENTIONAL AND GROTESQUE CROUCHING UNDER A SULLEN OVERHANGING SKY AND A LUSTRELESS MOON IN THE FOREGROUND FOUR SOLEMN MEN IN DRESS SUITS ARE WALKING ALONG THE SIDEWALK WITH A STRETCHER ON WHICH LIES A DRUNKEN WOMAN IN A WHITE EVENING DRESS HER HAND WHICH DANGLES OVER THE SIDE SPARKLES COLD WITH JEWELS GRAVELY THE MEN TURN IN AT A HOUSE THE WRONG HOUSE BUT NO ONE KNOWS THE WOMANS NAME AND NO ONE CARES AFTER GATSBYS DEATH THE EAST WAS HAUNTED FOR ME LIKE THAT DISTORTED BEYOND MY EYES POWER OF CORRECTION SO WHEN THE BLUE SMOKE OF BRITTLE LEAVES WAS IN THE AIR AND THE WIND BLEW THE WET LAUNDRY STIFF ON THE LINE I DECIDED TO COME BACK HOME THERE WAS ONE THING TO BE DONE BEFORE I LEFT AN AWKWARD UNPLEASANT THING THAT PERHAPS HAD BETTER HAVE BEEN LET ALONE BUT I WANTED TO LEAVE THINGS IN ORDER AND NOT JUST TRUST THAT OBLIGING AND INDIFFERENT SEA TO SWEEP MY REFUSE AWAY I SAW JORDAN BAKER AND TALKED OVER AND AROUND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO US TOGETHER AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED AFTERWARD TO ME AND SHE LAY PERFECTLY STILL LISTENING IN A BIG CHAIR SHE WAS DRESSED TO PLAY GOLF AND I REMEMBER THINKING SHE LOOKED LIKE A GOOD ILLUSTRATION HER CHIN RAISED A LITTLE JAUNTILY HER HAIR THE COLOUR OF AN AUTUMN LEAF HER FACE THE SAME BROWN TINT AS THE FINGERLESS GLOVE ON HER KNEE WHEN I HAD FINISHED SHE TOLD ME WITHOUT COMMENT THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO ANOTHER MAN I DOUBTED THAT THOUGH THERE WERE SEVERAL SHE COULD HAVE MARRIED AT A NOD OF HER HEAD BUT I PRETENDED TO BE SURPRISED FOR JUST A MINUTE I WONDERED IF I WASNT MAKING A MISTAKE THEN I THOUGHT IT ALL OVER AGAIN QUICKLY AND GOT UP TO SAY GOODBYE NEVERTHELESS YOU DID THROW ME OVER SAID JORDAN SUDDENLY YOU THREW ME OVER ON THE TELEPHONE I DONT GIVE A DAMN ABOUT YOU NOW BUT IT WAS A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME AND I FELT A LITTLE DIZZY FOR A WHILE WE SHOOK HANDS OH AND DO YOU REMEMBER SHE ADDED A CONVERSATION WE HAD ONCE ABOUT DRIVING A CAR WHY NOT EXACTLY YOU SAID A BAD DRIVER WAS ONLY SAFE UNTIL SHE MET ANOTHER BAD DRIVER WELL I MET ANOTHER BAD DRIVER DIDNT I I MEAN IT WAS CARELESS OF ME TO MAKE SUCH A WRONG GUESS I THOUGHT YOU WERE RATHER AN HONEST STRAIGHTFORWARD PERSON I THOUGHT IT WAS YOUR SECRET PRIDE IM THIRTY I SAID IM FIVE YEARS TOO OLD TO LIE TO MYSELF AND CALL IT HONOUR SHE DIDNT ANSWER ANGRY AND HALF IN LOVE WITH HER AND TREMENDOUSLY SORRY I TURNED AWAY ONE AFTERNOON LATE IN OCTOBER I SAW TOM BUCHANAN HE WAS WALKING AHEAD OF ME ALONG FIFTH AVENUE IN HIS ALERT AGGRESSIVE WAY HIS HANDS OUT A LITTLE FROM HIS BODY AS IF TO FIGHT OFF INTERFERENCE HIS HEAD MOVING SHARPLY HERE AND THERE ADAPTING ITSELF TO HIS RESTLESS EYES JUST AS I SLOWED UP TO AVOID OVERTAKING HIM HE STOPPED AND BEGAN FROWNING INTO THE WINDOWS OF A JEWELLERY STORE SUDDENLY HE SAW ME AND WALKED BACK HOLDING OUT HIS HAND WHATS THE MATTER NICK DO YOU OBJECT TO SHAKING HANDS WITH ME YES YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK OF YOU YOURE CRAZY NICK HE SAID QUICKLY CRAZY AS HELL I DONT KNOW WHATS THE MATTER WITH YOU TOM I INQUIRED WHAT DID YOU SAY TO WILSON THAT AFTERNOON HE STARED AT ME WITHOUT A WORD AND I KNEW I HAD GUESSED RIGHT ABOUT THOSE MISSING HOURS I STARTED TO TURN AWAY BUT HE TOOK A STEP AFTER ME AND GRABBED MY ARM I TOLD HIM THE TRUTH HE SAID HE CAME TO THE DOOR WHILE WE WERE GETTING READY TO LEAVE AND WHEN I SENT DOWN WORD THAT WE WERENT IN HE TRIED TO FORCE HIS WAY UPSTAIRS HE WAS CRAZY ENOUGH TO KILL ME IF I HADNT TOLD HIM WHO OWNED THE CAR HIS HAND WAS ON A REVOLVER IN HIS POCKET EVERY MINUTE HE WAS IN THE HOUSE HE BROKE OFF DEFIANTLY WHAT IF I DID TELL HIM THAT FELLOW HAD IT COMING TO HIM HE THREW DUST INTO YOUR EYES JUST LIKE HE DID IN DAISYS BUT HE WAS A TOUGH ONE HE RAN OVER MYRTLE LIKE YOUD RUN OVER A DOG AND NEVER EVEN STOPPED HIS CAR THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD SAY EXCEPT THE ONE UNUTTERABLE FACT THAT IT WASNT TRUE AND IF YOU THINK I DIDNT HAVE MY SHARE OF SUFFERING LOOK HERE WHEN I WENT TO GIVE UP THAT FLAT AND SAW THAT DAMN BOX OF DOG BISCUITS SITTING THERE ON THE SIDEBOARD I SAT DOWN AND CRIED LIKE A BABY BY GOD IT WAS AWFUL I COULDNT FORGIVE HIM OR LIKE HIM BUT I SAW THAT WHAT HE HAD DONE WAS TO HIM ENTIRELY JUSTIFIED IT WAS ALL VERY CARELESS AND CONFUSED THEY WERE CARELESS PEOPLE TOM AND DAISY THEY SMASHED UP THINGS AND CREATURES AND THEN RETREATED BACK INTO THEIR MONEY OR THEIR VAST CARELESSNESS OR WHATEVER IT WAS THAT KEPT THEM TOGETHER AND LET OTHER PEOPLE CLEAN UP THE MESS THEY HAD MADE I SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM IT SEEMED SILLY NOT TO FOR I FELT SUDDENLY AS THOUGH I WERE TALKING TO A CHILD THEN HE WENT INTO THE JEWELLERY STORE TO BUY A PEARL NECKLACE OR PERHAPS ONLY A PAIR OF CUFF BUTTONS RID OF MY PROVINCIAL SQUEAMISHNESS FOREVER GATSBYS HOUSE WAS STILL EMPTY WHEN I LEFT THE GRASS ON HIS LAWN HAD GROWN AS LONG AS MINE ONE OF THE TAXI DRIVERS IN THE VILLAGE NEVER TOOK A FARE PAST THE ENTRANCE GATE WITHOUT STOPPING FOR A MINUTE AND POINTING INSIDE PERHAPS IT WAS HE WHO DROVE DAISY AND GATSBY OVER TO EAST EGG THE NIGHT OF THE ACCIDENT AND PERHAPS HE HAD MADE A STORY ABOUT IT ALL HIS OWN I DIDNT WANT TO HEAR IT AND I AVOIDED HIM WHEN I GOT OFF THE TRAIN I SPENT MY SATURDAY NIGHTS IN NEW YORK BECAUSE THOSE GLEAMING DAZZLING PARTIES OF HIS WERE WITH ME SO VIVIDLY THAT I COULD STILL HEAR THE MUSIC AND THE LAUGHTER FAINT AND INCESSANT FROM HIS GARDEN AND THE CARS GOING UP AND DOWN HIS DRIVE ONE NIGHT I DID HEAR A MATERIAL CAR THERE AND SAW ITS LIGHTS STOP AT HIS FRONT STEPS BUT I DIDNT INVESTIGATE PROBABLY IT WAS SOME FINAL GUEST WHO HAD BEEN AWAY AT THE ENDS OF THE EARTH AND DIDNT KNOW THAT THE PARTY WAS OVER ON THE LAST NIGHT WITH MY TRUNK PACKED AND MY CAR SOLD TO THE GROCER I WENT OVER AND LOOKED AT THAT HUGE INCOHERENT FAILURE OF A HOUSE ONCE MORE ON THE WHITE STEPS AN OBSCENE WORD SCRAWLED BY SOME BOY WITH A PIECE OF BRICK STOOD OUT CLEARLY IN THE MOONLIGHT AND I ERASED IT DRAWING MY SHOE RASPINGLY ALONG THE STONE THEN I WANDERED DOWN TO THE BEACH AND SPRAWLED OUT ON THE SAND MOST OF THE BIG SHORE PLACES WERE CLOSED NOW AND THERE WERE HARDLY ANY LIGHTS EXCEPT THE SHADOWY MOVING GLOW OF A FERRYBOAT ACROSS THE SOUND AND AS THE MOON ROSE HIGHER THE INESSENTIAL HOUSES BEGAN TO MELT AWAY UNTIL GRADUALLY I BECAME AWARE OF THE OLD ISLAND HERE THAT FLOWERED ONCE FOR DUTCH SAILORS EYES A FRESH GREEN BREAST OF THE NEW WORLD ITS VANISHED TREES THE TREES THAT HAD MADE WAY FOR GATSBYS HOUSE HAD ONCE PANDERED IN WHISPERS TO THE LAST AND GREATEST OF ALL HUMAN DREAMS FOR A TRANSITORY ENCHANTED MOMENT MAN MUST HAVE HELD HIS BREATH IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS CONTINENT COMPELLED INTO AN AESTHETIC CONTEMPLATION HE NEITHER UNDERSTOOD NOR DESIRED FACE TO FACE FOR THE LAST TIME IN HISTORY WITH SOMETHING COMMENSURATE TO HIS CAPACITY FOR WONDER AND AS I SAT THERE BROODING ON THE OLD UNKNOWN WORLD I THOUGHT OF GATSBYS WONDER WHEN HE FIRST PICKED OUT THE GREEN LIGHT AT THE END OF DAISYS DOCK HE HAD COME A LONG WAY TO THIS BLUE LAWN AND HIS DREAM MUST HAVE SEEMED SO CLOSE THAT HE COULD HARDLY FAIL TO GRASP IT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT WAS ALREADY BEHIND HIM SOMEWHERE BACK IN THAT VAST OBSCURITY BEYOND THE CITY WHERE THE DARK FIELDS OF THE REPUBLIC ROLLED ON UNDER THE NIGHT GATSBY BELIEVED IN THE GREEN LIGHT THE ORGASTIC FUTURE THAT YEAR BY YEAR RECEDES BEFORE US IT ELUDED US THEN BUT THATS NO MATTER TOMORROW WE WILL RUN FASTER STRETCH OUT OUR ARMS FURTHER AND ONE FINE
